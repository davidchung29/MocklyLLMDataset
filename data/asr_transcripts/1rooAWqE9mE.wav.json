I will soon tell you where you can download my full set of 21 engineering manager interview questions and top scoring answers including the ones we are covering today during this presentation. Question number two, what makes a good engineering manager? Now there are several qualities that help make an engineering manager perform to a high standard being commercially aware is one of them being able to manage and lead a team of engineers is another. So let's look at the others in the following answer. What makes a good engineering manager? Four things make a good engineering manager. Experience within the industry you are working in technical competence being commercially aware and the ability to complete projects and tasks quickly and in line with predetermined specifications. A good engineering manager is an all-rounder and someone who has the relevant management and leadership capabilities to lead a team of engineers to achieve very specific goals within set time frames. Now it is essential that an engineering manager supports the senior management team and he or she works towards achieving the commercial and financial goals of the business. That's a very concise and confident answer that helps you to stand out during your engineering manager interview. Now don't go anywhere because I still have more questions and answers to give you but when you're ready if you click that link in the top right-hand corner of the video it will take you through to my website pacmaintovue.com and you can download my full set of 21 engineering manager interview questions and top scoring answers including the ones covered during this presentation today but here is the next question to help you. Why do you want to work here as an engineering manager? So this might be posed as why do you want to work for us. Now this engineering manager interview question is assessing how much research you have carried out into their organization and whether your motivations for working there are genuine. So here's another great example answer to assist you. Why do you want to work here as an engineering manager? I want to work for you as an engineering manager because I am seeking employment with a forward thinking innovative company that wants to continually grow and thrive within its industry. I am a passionate engineering manager and I want the time I do spend at work to be put to good use. I conducted lots of research into your company before applying for this position and three things stood out. Your track record of achievement, the way you are always pushing the boundaries and seeking to improve and the fact that you are a responsible organization that wants to build a sustainable and progressive business. Now I genuinely believe my passion and the enthusiasm and levels of commitment will be a good match for your organization. That's an have a really good stand out answer that helps you to pass your engineering manager interview. Here is the next question. Tell us about a time when your team members disagreed on a technical solution or implementation. How did you handle the situation? Now this tough engineering manager interview question assesses your level of authority and whether you can turn a disagreement into a positive outcome for the engineering project you are leading. So here's another great answer to help you. Tell us about a time when your team members disagreed on a technical solution or implementation. How did you handle the situation? I was working in a previous engineering manager position managing a fast-paced product development project with a team of six people. Now during the initial project brief, two of the engineers disagreed on the best way to implement their particular element of the project. I took control of the discussion and I asked them individually to outline their proposal including the benefits of approaching things their way. I followed up with probing questions, asking them to provide real life examples of where it had worked previously. Now after listening to them I chose the one that I felt would give the best outcome based on the project's specification. As the engineering manager I will always listen to my team's suggestions to find the best way forward and I will never be afraid to take control and make decisive decisions that will help us to quickly achieve our objectives. It's a really good answer. You are using your team's experience to help you make the right decision based on the engineering project you are leading. Here is a difficult question. If you were recruiting an engineer for your team, what would you look for? Now part of your responsibility as the engineering manager will be to recruit and hire engineers. Therefore, to do this competently you need to know what to look for in engineering applicants. So here's a really good model answer to help you. If you were recruiting an engineer for your team, what would you look for? Here we go. There are several characteristics and traits I would look for when recruiting an engineer. Teamwork and technical competence are the first two. I would want someone who puts the needs of the team first, someone who can collaborate in a professional manner without conflict and someone who has the expertise and experience to perform their duties quickly and to the required standard. I would recruit an engineer who has a proven track record of problem solving, someone who can analyse data to develop real-life engineering solutions and someone who possesses excellent communication skills. The engineer is attitude to work, their attention to detail skills and their commitment to the organization would be other, crucial factors in deciding on the right candidate. Finally, I would want to hire someone who is passionate about engineering and who takes responsibility for their own continuous learning and development. So that shows you know what to look for in the right engineering applicant and you are not afraid to hire the right person. What are your strengths and weaknesses? Now this question is guarantee to come up during your engineering manager interview, structure your response so that you give four or five strengths and then just one weakness that is not a match for the job description. So here's my example answer to help you. What are your strengths and weaknesses? My strengths include my project scheduling and completion skills. I am renowned for delivering time sensitive projects to high standards and within budget. I'm a confident engineering manager who makes difficult decisions and who holds his team accountable. Other important strengths include my communication skills and my levels of commercial awareness. I will work with the company directors and executives to ensure all commercial engineering objectives are met. My weakness includes the fact that I find it hard to say no to people and I don't like asking other people for help. Now since I can remember, I tend to say yes when people ask me for help or assistance even if I don't have the capacity to take on the extra work. However, when it comes to me asking for other people's help, I prefer to figure things out for myself which is not always the right approach to take. I am the type of engineering manager who believes there is always something new to learn and I will always be open to constructive feedback from my seniors and directors and from other people who I respect.
