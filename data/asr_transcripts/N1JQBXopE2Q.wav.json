Thank you very much indeed. So the first question that is going to come up at your Amazon Business Analyst interview is tell me about yourself. Let me give you two important tips before I give you my top scoring example answer. So tip number one, Amazon Business Analysts must be excellent communicators and have confidence in their abilities. Therefore, please make sure you practice your answer several times before your interview. And tip number two, good things to include in your answer are the skills and qualities you have that are a match for the Amazon Business Analyst job description, accomplishments from previous work positions and make sure you reference the 16 Amazon leadership principles in your response. So here is a brilliant example answer to help you share your interview. Tell me about yourself here we go. Thank you for this opportunity to become a business analyst for Amazon. I am a technically driven and collaborative business analyst with the experience, knowledge and soft skills to meet the roles demands. After obtaining my degree at insert the university, I worked for several organizations where I developed my analytical programming and business automation skills. I am a high achiever. In my last position, I was praised by my manager for my responsive work ethic and how I helped build and managed company key performance indicators to measure, control and benchmark reporting processes. Before applying for this position, I studied Amazon's leadership principles to ensure I have what it takes to add considerable value to the organization. If you hire me, I will support cross-functional teams to achieve their objectives, take ownership of reporting processes and work hard to innovate and improve customer experience. And I look forward to sharing additional details in the interview regarding my suitability for this position. So that is a brilliant example answer to that first, Amazon Business Analyst interview question. Tell me about yourself. Don't forget, write down your answer and practice it before your interview to demonstrate confidence and good communication skills. So you can either pause the video if you want to and write down the tips, questions and answers as we work through them together or if you wait, I will soon tell you where you can instantly download my full set of 21 brilliant answers to difficult but common Amazon Business Analyst interview questions. But here is the next question that I strongly recommend you prepare for. Why do you want to work for Amazon? Tip number one. So this next common interview question is assessing your motivations for wanting to work for this brilliant organization. Now I believe Amazon is probably the best organization in the world. They are a fantastic employer and therefore competition is fierce. So you must demonstrate a genuine desire for wanting to work at Amazon in your response. So tip number two, good things to include in your answer are, Amazon's impressive track record of success. So this means you will be working for a high achieving organization. You should also again mention Amazon's 16 leadership principles and how these will be the foundation of your work as a business analyst. And then finally, you can say that Amazon is a company that takes calculated risks and you find that attractive because that means you will be able to collaborate on exciting and forward thinking projects that make a real difference. So here is another brilliant example answer to help you. Why do you want to work for Amazon? Here we go. I want to work for Amazon because you are the industry leader and have been for a long time. Amazon's successful track record tells me I will work for an innovative forward thinking, calculated risk taking organization that impowers its staff to contribute ideas to the business's commercial objectives. I thrive in fast-paced dynamic environments where critical thinking is essential. Finally, I want to work for Amazon because of your 16 leadership principles. These are values that I believe in. The leadership principles will give me clear foundations to work from and the fact that you are constantly improving, learning and customer centric gives me the confidence to be pushed and challenged in my work which is important to me. So that's another really good answer that's going to help you stand out from the competition at your Amazon business analyst interview. Now don't go anywhere because I still have many more questions, tips and answers to give you. But when you are ready, you can click the link in the top right-hand corner of the video and head straight through at my website, pastmaintevue.com and download a copy of these slides plus my full set of 21 great answers to difficult but common Amazon business analyst interview questions. But here is the next question that comes up all the time in Amazon business analyst interviews. And that question is describe a time when you used data to solve a complex problem. What was the outcome? Tip number one. Now the majority of your Amazon business analyst interview will be focused on answering behavioral interview questions that are centered on the 16 leadership principles and tip number two. When answering this challenging behavioral interview question, I recommend you give a specific situation where you solve the problem that had a positive impact on the company. So let me give you a great sample answer to help you pass your interview. Describe a time when you used data to solve a complex problem here we go. In my previous analyst role for an e-commerce company, I was tasked with improving customer retention which had been declining for several months. The challenge was to identify the root causes of customer churn which involved analyzing a vast amount of customer interaction data, purchase histories and use of feedback. I began by segmenting the customers into different cohorts based on their purchase frequency, product categories and engagement levels with our marketing campaigns. Using SQL and Python, I created queries to extract key metrics from our database such as average order value, the time between repeat purchases and customer lifetime value. After analyzing the data, I identified a few key insights, customers who received personalized product recommendations had a 20% higher retention rate. A specific product category had a higher return rate leading to customer dissatisfaction. Our email campaigns were not effectively targeting high value customers as they were receiving generic offers. Based on these findings, I recommended that we personalise our marketing emails based on customer purchase behavior and preferences. Additionally, I suggested improving product quality in the category with a higher return rate. These changes led to a 15% improvement in customer retention within three months and they noticeable increase in customer satisfaction as reflected in our net promoter score. So that is a really good in-depth answer to that common Amazon business analyst interview question describe a time when you used data to solve a complex problem. Here is the next question, again that I strongly recommend you prepare for. Describe a time when you had to make a quick decision. Tip number one. Now Amazon business analysts must make fast decision that allow the organization to continually improve and meet customer demand. Tip number two, give a specific situation where you used data and information to improve company systems or processes that had a positive outcome on the customer or client experience. So let me give you another brilliant example answer to help you. Describe a time when you had to make a quick decision. In my previous role, there was an instance where I had to make a quick decision during a critical online sales event. We were running a flash sale on one of our most popular product lines and midway through the event, I noticed a significant drop in conversion rates. This was alarming as it could have severely impacted the revenue generated from the sale and the team needed a swift resolution. With limited time to conduct a full analysis, I immediately pulled real-time data from our sales dashboard, I noticed that many customers were abandoning their carts at the payment page. I quickly cross-references with customer feedback, we had been receiving an identified a pattern. Several customers were encountering issues with a specific payment gateway that was not processing orders properly. I made the quick decision to advise the team to temporarily disable that payment option and re-root customers to our PayPal payment option. Within minutes, our tech team implemented the change and I monitored the conversion rates closely. The result was a swift recovery in sales conversions with a 12% increase in the next hour, which helped save the remainder of the event. So that is another brilliant example answer. You can see how I am using percentage increases at the end of my answers to demonstrate that I have had a positive impact on the company and that's a really good tip to give you. Where possible use percentage increases as a result of your actions? Here is an next question. Again, that comes up all the time in Amazon, Business, Analyst, Interviews. What would you do if you had a conflict with one of your co-workers? So tip number one, the ability to collaborate effectively with your co-workers at Amazon is crucial to the company's success. So this next common interview question assesses your ability to overcome conflict to ensure continued progress in teams. And tip number two, I recommend in your answer you say that you would take ownership of the conflict to empower the team to quickly move forward. So let me put all of that together in my brilliant sample answer to help you. What would you do if you had a conflict with one of your co-workers? Conflict teams can be healthy because it demonstrates passion and they desire to achieve strong results for the employer. However, if not handled professionally, it can hinder progress. Therefore, I would do three things to overcome it swiftly. First, I would assess my words and actions to ensure I wasn't the cause. Next, I would meet privately with my co-worker to establish their views and ideas based on the team's objectives. And finally, I would hold open and honest conversations with my co-worker to find an amicable solution that empowers to move forward. So that's a really good answer because you are saying you will take ownership of the conflict to achieve a satisfactory solution that is in the best interests of your team and employer. It's a really good professional answer. Here is an next question again that comes up all the time. This is another behavioral interview question. This is a difficult one. Tell me about a time you made a difficult decision to sacrifice short-term gain for a longer term goal. How do you answer this question? Let me give you two tips. Tip number one. So this next difficult Amazon business analyst interview question is assessing the leadership principles of our right a lot and insist on the highest standards. Tip number two, give a specific situation where you recommended your company took an alternative course of action to achieve improved results. So let me give you another brilliant example response. Tell me about a time you made a difficult decision to sacrifice short-term gain for a longer term goal. Here we go. In my previous role as a business analyst, we were launching a new product line that had high revenue potential. There was a lot of pressure from upper management to launch it as soon as possible to capitalize on the upcoming holiday season. However, during the final stages of testing, I discovered through data analysis that our supply chain wasn't equipped to handle the surge in demand we were projecting. If we went ahead with the launch, we risked running into significant full-filmed issues which would lead to customer dissatisfaction and damage to our brand's reputation. I recommended delaying the launch by four weeks. This decision meant missing out on the holiday sales boost, but it would give us time to strengthen our supply chain, streamline logistics and then show the product was delivered without any major setbacks. It was a difficult decision as we had to forego short-term revenue and there was an initial resistance from some stakeholders. However, once I presented the data showing the potential long-term benefits, they agreed to delay the launch. In the long run, this decision led to a higher customer satisfaction, stronger brand loyalty and even higher revenue than initially projected. So that's another great example answer. I recommend when you answer these difficult Amazon behavioral interview questions, you give in-depth situations and these are in-depth examples where you are demonstrating those leadership principles. Here is the next question. Why should we hire you? Tip number one. So this next common Amazon business analyst interview question will be asked to all candidates and the Amazon hiring manager will use yours and the other candidate's answers to help them decide which analyst can add the most value to the business. So tip number two, make sure you give several reasons why you are the best candidate and again, reference the leadership principles in your response. How do you do that? Here is another example response. Why should we hire you? I am an ideal candidate for the Amazon business analyst role due to my strong analytical skills, problem solving abilities and alignment with Amazon's leadership principles. I am deeply committed to customer obsession using data to provide actionable insights that enhance the customer experience. I take ownership of my work ensuring long-term solutions and I act with bias for action making data driven decisions quickly and effectively. I also dive deep into data ensuring that my insights are thorough and lead to informed strategies. I am constantly pushing for improvement in line with insist on the highest standards always striving for innovation and excellence. My skills and values align perfectly with Amazon's mission and I am eager to contribute to your continued success. Great answer. I love these responses.
