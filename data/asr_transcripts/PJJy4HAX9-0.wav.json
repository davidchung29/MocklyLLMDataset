Head through to my website, passmaintv.com and you can download my full set of 21 Amazon process assistant, job interview questions and top scoring answers including the ones we are working through together today. But here's an next question for you. If you saw someone being unsafe at work what would you do? Now one of Amazon's 16 leadership principles is called strive to be the Earth's best employer. And part of that principle is always operating in a safe manner. Now when you are answer demonstrate you are awareness of safety and how important it is to manage it effectively in your role as an Amazon process assistant. And just quickly I will talk more about the 16 leadership principles later on towards the end of this tutorial. They are absolutely crucial to your success in my opinion when you attend your Amazon interview. So here's a great example answer to this next Amazon interview question. If you saw someone being unsafe at work what would you do? Here we go. I would tell them to stop what they were doing straight away. Now one of the 16 Amazon leadership principles is strive to be the Earth's best employer. And that means always carrying out your duties with safety in mind. I would explain what they were doing wrong and what they needed to do to put things right. I would also insist they read the operational safety procedures again that were applicable to their role and the task they were carrying out. I would then reaffirm to all Amazon associates in my team the importance of safety and read out the standard operating procedure. Finally, there may also be the need to update the standard operating procedure relevant to the task that was being carried out unsafely. And if that was the case I would liais with my area manager or safety supervisor to get this actions. So that demonstrates that you understand you need to stop. Get them to stop what they are doing straight away. And also make sure that they are retrain. They read the operational safety procedures again to familiarise themselves with what they should be doing that's relevant to that task. Can you are also? And I think this is important making reference to the leadership principles in your answer. Here's the next interview question I recommend you prepare for. What are the main responsibilities of an Amazon process assistant? Now my advice is to make sure you read the job description for the Amazon process assistant role before you attend your interview. This is really important because if you are unable to explain the core responsibilities you will have in the role during your interview you are unlikely to be successful. So here's a great example answer to help you. What are the main responsibilities of an Amazon process assistant here we go? As an Amazon process assistant I would have a multitude of different responsibilities. I would be responsible for delegating duties to team members. Taking control of team meetings, directing and assigning duties in response to operational requirements and liaising with internal and external suppliers. As an Amazon process assistant I would also be required to provide cover for area managers when they were on vacation and sure compliance with standard operating procedures, track associate's work performance and take part in Amazon's operational excellence initiatives. Now other duties and responsibilities include helping with production duties and analyzing the efficiency of daily production goals and workflows, maintaining a clean and safe working environment, reporting injuries straight away to the area manager and providing coaching and training to Amazon associates in respect of their duties and safety compliance responsibilities. That's a really good example answer that shows you have thoroughly read the job description and you understand responsibilities that are relevant to the position of an Amazon process assistant. Here is the next question. What was the one task you were involved in where it seemed you were meant to fail? Now this is a really difficult interview question and it's more commonly referred to as a behavioral interview question and it's aligned with the leadership principles. Now this next Amazon process assistant interview question is obviously assessing your determination, resilience and your ability to solve challenging problems whilst under pressure. So my advice is think of a specific situation you have been in where against the odds you managed to achieve a successful outcome. So here's a great example answer to help you prepare for your interview. What was the one task you were involved in where it seemed you were meant to fail? I was working in a previous role, processing and packing orders for customers following a weekend sale. Now we had sold hundreds of products over the weekend and we needed to get them out before 3pm that afternoon. Now part way through the morning are internet crashed which meant I could not access the orders. Now not being deterred I ran across to another business on the site and requested use of their internet to process the orders and also print off the delivery labels. Now once I returned to the site to carry on my duties a team member informed me that we had run out of packing boxes. Now time was now running out. So I asked 2 team members to drive out to 2 separate packaging companies in the local area to buy some replacement boxes. Now I sent 2 people out just in case one of the packaging companies did not have the boxes we needed. Now when they returned an hour later we managed to get all the orders packed and sent out just in time for the 3pm postal deadline. That's a really good answer because it is specific in nature. It gives an actual example but it also shows that you have several challenging problems to deal with but you use your initiative to overcome them to achieve a successful outcome and that's really important. Here's the next Amazon interview question I recommend you prepare for. How do you handle stress? Now as an Amazon process assistant you will have multiple duties and responsibilities. Therefore it is essential you can handle the stress and pressure that will inevitably come with the make sure you give a confident answer that shows you can prioritize and plan your work effectively because when you do prioritize and plan your work you can then handle the stress that comes with the role. So here's my example answer to help you. How do you handle stress here we go? I handle stress by first and foremost prioritizing my working day in advance. I determine which tasks need my attention, what the likely obstacles are and how I can potentially overcome them. Prioritizing tasks and thinking ahead helps to minimize stress. Now if you understand that stress and pressure are part of your working day you can remain calm and composed and then deal with challenging situations as and when they arise much easier. Finally to handle stress and pressure I maintain a healthy lifestyle outside of work. I attend the gym several times a week which helps me keep a positive mindset and strong concentration levels. That's a really good answer to that common Amazon process assistant interview question how do you handle stress? Here is the next question tell me about a time when you helped develop the career of a team member. Now part of your role as an Amazon process assistant will be to help develop team members. Now Amazon employees are selfless in their approach to supporting motivating and encouraging people in their teams to achieve great things. Here's my example answer to help you. Tell me about a time when you helped develop the career of a team member here we go. In a previous role a co-worker was trying for an internal promotion. They asked if they could shadow me for a week to gain an insight into my daily tasks and how I approached my responsibilities. Now they needed to develop skills in certain areas to meet the essential criteria of the role they were applying for so I agreed to help them. Now to begin with I sat down and determined what they wanted to learn and achieve over the week they were shadowing me. We drew up a list of the top 10 things they wanted to learn before commencing work. Now I showed them how I prioritized daily tasks based on the company's commercial objectives and what I did to double check everything was completed to the right standard. Now where possible I asked them to perform some of my duties so they gained real hands-on experience and at the end of the week we had worked through everything that was on the list and they thanked me for my assistance. Now when my colleague went to interview they successfully gained a promotion they wanted which was great news. So that demonstrates that you are a selfless employee and you also plan what you wanted to teach the person during the week they were shadowing you so it's a really good answer. Now in a second I'm going to give you another video right here on YouTube that I strongly strongly recommend you watch because it will really help you to pass your process assistant interview.
