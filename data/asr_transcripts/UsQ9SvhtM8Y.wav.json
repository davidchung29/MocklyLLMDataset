  "text": " Hello there, my name is Richard McMunn from the Interview Training website, passmindevu.com. And in this tutorial, I will teach you how to answer Amazon, think big and dive deep interview questions. So Amazon has a set of 16 leadership principles and two of them are think big and dive deep. And during your Amazon interview, there is a strong possibility you will have to answer questions based on these two leadership principles. So if you have an Amazon interview coming up for any role, make sure you stay tuned because I promise to help you pass it. And to achieve that goal, this is what I'm going to cover during the tutorial. So I will give you a list of Amazon interview questions that are based on the leadership principles of think big and dive deep. I will also give you some really important tips on how to construct top scoring answers to these questions. I will then give you example unique responses to all of the questions to help you prepare. And finally, I will tell you how you can access further downloadable resources to help you pass your Amazon interview.

I can only help you if you are subscribed. And please just give the video a like because that motivates me to create more content for you. Thank you very much. So the first Amazon interview question I want to tackle is based on the leadership principle of think big. And the question is, tell me about a time when you took a risk at work. So before I give you my example answer to that difficult Amazon interview question, let me tell you the best way to structure your answer. And that is to use what is called the start technique. Start stands for situation task action and result. So you start off your answer by outlining the situation you were faced with. You then give brief details about the task that needed doing. You then go into specific details about the action you took to complete the task before finishing off and telling the interview other results. Following your actions. So whenever you have to answer an Amazon behavioral interview question that is focused on the leadership principles. My advice is to use the start technique to structure your response. Let me now show you the start technique in action for my example response to the Amazon interview question. Tell me about a time when you took a risk at work. Here we go. Whilst working for a previous company I was concerned about the experience some of our customers were receiving. Now the career company we used to deliver products was very cost effective but they weren't very reliable. And some of our customers had complained about poor service standards. I felt it was my task to find an alternative career company that could help improve customer service standards. Now after researching new careers I found one that promised exceptional service standards. Now the only issue was they were twice as expensive as the previous career. However I felt this was a risk worth taking because I believed that by improving customer service standards it would result in better feedback online which would then in turn attract new customers. And offset the additional expense of the new career. So I decided to take the risk and we signed up with the new career. Literally four weeks after using the new career online positive reviews increased significantly and this attracted new business. And three months later new customer revenue had overtaken the cost of the new career meaning the risk had a positive outcome. So that's a really good example answer to that first Amazon leadership principle interview question tell me about the time when you took a risk at work. And that's based on the think big Amazon leadership principle and you can see that by using that process the start technique situation task action and result you are able to construct a brilliant top scoring answer. Now don't go anywhere because I still have many more questions and top scoring answers to give you. But when you're ready click the link in the top right and corner of the video head through to my website passmaintevue.com and you can download my full set of Amazon leadership principles into your questions and top scoring answers including the ones we are working through together today. However here is the next question for you. Next on the leadership principle of dive deep and the question is tell me about a time when you used information or data to make a decision. Let me give you my example answer again that utilizes the start technique here we go. In a previous role I was part of a team whose responsibility it was to launch a new company product online. Now it was our task to use data and information to increase return on investment from the initial product marketing campaign. Now before attending the first follow up meeting after the initial product launch I conducted some research into the results from the online marketing campaign. Now I noticed that certain keywords and phrases were not converting which resulted in unnecessary expenditure. Now during the team meeting I presented a list of keywords and phrases that were converting and I recommended we increased the advertising spend for those campaigns whilst at the same time deleting the ones that brought no return. Now the team agreed this was a great idea to implement immediately and after analyzing the results seven days later our sales had increased by 15%. That's a really good specific example of where somebody has del deep into information and data to make a decision that's in the best interest of the organization. And again it utilizes the start technique so it's a really good format to use when preparing for your Amazon interview. Let's now move on and take a look at the next Amazon leadership principle interview question and this is based on the leadership principle of think big. Tell me about a time when the organization you were working for adopted one of your ideas. Now this is a difficult question but Amazon being in my opinion the greatest company in the world wants to employ people who can come up with really good ideas. That's going to help their organization move forward. Let me give you an example answer. So the question again is. Tell me about a time when the organization you were working for adopted one of your ideas here we go. In my previous job I felt the prices we sold our products for were too cheap. The products were created to a high standard but I felt the cheap prices were putting off some customers due to perceived value. Now it was my task to present my suggestion to my manager based on evidence. So I put together a short presentation that included my ideas and examples of other companies in different sectors that took advantage of increased prices that reflected the standard of their products. I then presented my idea to my manager. Now he was reluctant to change the pricing model that we had used for several years. So I suggested we should try increasing the prices on one or two products initially to gauge the reaction to which he agreed. Now 14 days after increasing the prices we assessed the data and we had actually sold 37 more products compared to the previous period. Now it proved that the cheaper prices were putting off some customers. So we ended up rolling out the idea to all company products which helped to significantly increase company revenue over the year. So that's a really good example of someone who has come up with a really good idea that has improved the performance and the efficiency of an organisation. And again, as you can see, it utilizes a start technique. Let's move on to the next question which again is based on the dive deep Amazon leadership principle. And the question is, tell me about a time when you had to delve deeper into information or data to come up with a suitable solution to a problem. This is a really difficult interview question. A difficult Amazon interview question to answer correctly. Let me give you my example response. Here we go. Tell me about a time when you had to delve deeper into information or data to come up with a suitable solution to a problem. Here we go. In my previous job, I was concerned that sales were starting to drop compared to the previous year. It was my task to delve deep into the information I had available to produce actionable strategies that would quickly result in increased sales. So I gave an information and data from various sources including marketing campaign results, lead generation and retention rates, Google trends and website visitors. So starting with the marketing campaign results, I quickly established these work converting at the previous year's results based on the same expenditure. Google trends indicated that based on seasonal demand, this was the same year on year. I then moved on to the number of website visitors we were receiving and the figures were healthy and in keeping with the previous year's figures. However, when I came to analyze lead generation and retention rates, these were down by 30%. Now upon further inspection of the data, I found that website leads were unsubscribing within two days of the initial sign-up. Now the reason for this was that the email campaign assigned to the new online leads contained an error that resulted in a loss of trust between the lead and the company. Now once I had spoken to the IT department, the error was quickly rectified. After analyzing the results 28 days later, website leads were being retained one small and sales had started to increase back up to the previous years levels. So that's a really good example, Answer. To that question, tell me about a time when you had to delve deeper into information or data to come up with a suitable solution. And I like that answer because you are using an assessing lots of different sources of information and data and you are basically eliminating the ones that are fine and you eventually find where the problem is and you come up with a really good solution for the business. So that shows that you can dive deep. Let's now move on to the next Amazon leadership principles interview question. This again is think big and the question is tell me about a time when you used a radical approach to solve a problem. Now the key word here is radical. It doesn't say tell me about a time when you, you know, solve the problem. It's a used a radical approach. So you have to come up with something that's unique and different. And again, one that contains a little bit of a risk. You need to try risks because risks can often lead to reward within organizations. So here's my example answer that again utilizes that start technique to the Amazon interview question. Tell me about a time when you used a radical approach to solve a problem. Here we go. In my previous job, all team members were required to attend meetings regardless of whether they were really needed or not. So I calculated that this was a significant waste of some people's time and a new approach was needed. I decided to explore different options for holding team meetings with a view to radicalising the process to increase productivity levels. So after thinking of different ideas, I came up with a simple solution. It was a very basic idea, but one that radicalised company meetings moving forward. Once the meeting agenda was disseminated amongst everyone in the group, I stated that attendance at the meeting was purely voluntary. If people felt their attendance at the meeting was not warranted, and their time could be better allocated elsewhere, they did not need to attend. Now at the end of every meeting, action points would be sent to all staff, whether they attended the meeting or not. And it would be their responsibility to action them before the start of the next meeting. It also meant that those people who attended company meetings were empowered to contribute in a positive and fruitful manner. Now this radical approach to company meetings had a significant impact on staff morale and productivity levels. That's another great example. The shows you're not afraid to take a risk and you're capable of coming up with a radical approach to something that you think needs changing. And as a positive outcome, so it's a really good example answer. Now the next thing to do is you want more Amazon leadership principles, interview questions and answers.
