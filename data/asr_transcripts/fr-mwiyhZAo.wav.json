Okay, let's jump straight into the presentation and start working through those 21 top interview questions and answers. So for your convenience, I have placed the time stamps to each interview question in the description below the video. So feel free to jump to each interview question as and when you want to. So the first interview question is tell us about yourself. Here's a great answer for you. My name is Richard and thank you for giving me this opportunity to date. I have the skills and qualities needed to match the job description and to perform highly in the role. I have experience of working with other people. I'm someone who is always seeking to learn and develop and I have the creativity to help your business grow whilst offering excellent service to your customers. Outside of work, I keep myself fit and active. I am a positive person who always embraces change and I will always take responsibility for my own professional development. So that's a brilliant quick answer to the first interview question. Tell us about yourself. Interview question number two is why do you want this job? He is a great quick answer. I want this job because it is a role that I am very passionate about and I see my long-term career in this position. I also want this job because having researched your company, you are clearly innovative. You support your employees in their work and you are always striving to move forward and develop. Interview question number three of our top 21 quick answers to interview questions is how did you hear about this position? Here's a great answer. I have held a keen interest in your company for several months now and I've been on the lookout for this role to be advertised to make sure I was notified as soon as the position was advertised, I kept a daily check on the local job boards. That's the best way to answer that common interview question. Interview question number four is what are your strengths? Now, this question is going to come up during your interview. Here's a great answer. My strengths include my ability to learn things very quickly. The fact that I am a people person, which means I will always be a positive role model for your company while stealing with your customers. And the fact that I see change as a positive thing and I will always embrace it for the better good of the company. That's a brilliant answer to that common interview question. What are your strengths? Question number five is a difficult one. What's your biggest weakness? Here's a quick answer to it. My biggest weakness is the fact that I don't yet have much experience in talking to large groups of people. This is something I'm very keen to improve on. So if any opportunities were to arise in this position to gain experience in this area, I would certainly want to take advantage of that. That's a great answer to that question. What's your biggest weakness? Interview question number six is how would you deal with conflict with a co worker? Here's a quick answer to help you. I would deal with the conflict by seeing if I was doing anything to contribute to the conflict before speaking to my co worker in private to find an amicable way forward that we were both comfortable with. I would always put the needs of my team first and try to overcome the conflict so we could quickly move forward. That's a great answer, a professional answer to that question. How would you deal with conflict with a co worker? Question number seven of our 21 quick answers to common interview questions is where do you see yourself in five years? Here we go. I see myself hopefully working for your company, either in the same role or having gained advancement to a higher level. In five years, I would have also developed significantly and be seen as a trusted, reliable and productive member of the company. Interview question number eight, what's your ideal work environment? This is a tricky one, but here's a great quick answer to help you. My ideal work environment is positive. Is one where everyone in the team seeks to continually grow and improve and where I would get to use my creative side to help the business grow and develop. That's a cracking answer to that interview question. What's your ideal work environment? Question number nine is one that's definitely going to come up during your job interview. What experience do you have relevant to this role? Here's a quick answer. I have experience of dealing with clients and customers in a manner that is representative of a company's vision. I have experience of collaborating with other people in a team to achieve a common objective. And I also have experience of solving problems independently and completing time sensitive tasks under pressure. That's another great answer. Interview question number 10 is how would other people describe you? Here's a great answer. My friends and previous co-workers have often described me as someone who is driven, enthusiastic and upbeat. I believe they would also describe me as someone they could turn to whenever they need an assistance. Someone they could rely on to help them out at short notice and someone who has a can-do attitude and that takes ownership of difficult situations. Interview question number 11 is a really difficult one and that is describe yourself in three words. Here's a great answer. I would describe myself as productive, commercially aware and self-multiply motivated. I am productive, which means you will always see me achieving good things for the business. I am commercially aware, which means I understand the importance of always doing a good job on time to help the business thrive. And I'm also self-motivated, which means I will take it by myself to quickly and diligently work through all tasks and duties to help the team achieve its objectives. Interview question number 12. What's been your greatest achievement? Here we go. My greatest achievement was in my previous role where I helped the company increase sales. This was achieved by improving customer service standards and by thinking of different ways to help the business market its products via social media. That's a great answer. Interview question number 13 is what do you do outside of work or they might say to you what are your hobbies and interests? Here's a quick answer. Outside of work, I like to keep myself fit and active and I visit the gym a few times a week. This keeps me motivated and it also helps to boost my concentration levels whilst I am at work. I am also a family person and I often spend time at weekends with those closest to me. Finally, I like to read self-development books and I always have a good book on the go at any one time. That's a great answer, a smart answer to that interview question. What do you do outside of work? Interview question number 14 of our 21 quick answers to interview questions is what can you do for us that other candidates can't? Now you need to answer this question carefully. Here's a great quick answer. I can bring a diverse set of skills, qualities and experience to the team that I believe will help your business grow. I am a strong communicator and I will always try to solve problems without troubling my manager. I will always take care of your customers which in turn will increase sales. I can also bring a level of knowledge to the role that I believe is unrivaled and I will always work hard to ensure you see a positive return on your investment by hiring me. That's a cracking answer to that difficult interview question. Interview question number 15 is why do you want to work for us? Here we go. I want to work for your company because you are socially responsible. You have a strong set of workplace values that align with my own ambitions and aspirations and you have a brilliant track record of achievement. If I am successful, I can genuinely see myself working for your company for many years to come. Interview question number 16 is how would you deal with a difficult customer? Here's a great answer. I would listen to the customer. I would ask them questions to establish their needs and I would try to establish a connection with them. At all times I would be professional and I would try to find a solution to their problem quickly and calmly. It would be my goal to keep the customer on board and to ensure they had a good experience with the company. That's a great answer that shows you are a smart employee. Interview question number 17 is a really difficult one and that is tell me about a time when you failed. Here's a really smart answer to help you pass your interview. In my last job, I was working as part of a team that failed to finish a project on time. Now we simply failed because we had not listened to the brief fully at the start of the project and things got missed. As soon as we realised we had made a mistake, we informed our manager, we apologised and we discussed what we had learned from the experience to make sure it never happened again. That's a smart answer because it shows the interviewer that you are honest and more importantly, you take responsibility for your mistakes and your failures. Interview question number 18 is why do you want to leave your current job? Now you need to give a really short answer to this question. Here it is. I want to leave my job because I'm seeking a fresh challenge with an exciting and innovative company such as yours that has ambitious plans for the future. That's a great answer. Interview question number 19 is again definitely going to come up during your interview. And that is why should we hire you? Now you need to be the stand out candidate in your response. Here's a quick short answer that's going to help you to post your interview. I believe you should hire me because I am a very fast learner and I need little supervision moving forward. I also believe you should hire me because I will represent your business positively and I will treat your customers well. I will also ensure I find ways to help the business grow whilst also helping you to save money by using resources in a frugal and responsible manner. That is a cracking answer to that question. Why should we hire you? Interview question number 20. What did you dislike about your previous job? This is a tough one. Here we go. There was only one thing that frustrated me slightly about my last job. And that was the fact that I felt we could have achieved so much more as a company. There were lots of opportunities in the market for us to expand and grow, but the company owners seemed satisfied with where the company was at. Interview question number 21. Do you have any questions for us? So at the end of the interview, they will say that to you. Here's a quick answer. Thank you. Yes, I have just three questions to ask, please. Question number one, what would you need me to concentrate on in the first 30 days of starting? Question number two, what are the plans for the company over the next five years? And finally, question number three, how has the position evolved over the years? So there's three smart questions to ask at the end of your interview.
