Thank you very much indeed. Okay, let's get started with two very important tips for answering behavioral interview questions tip number one. In your answer, make sure you refer to a specific situation you have previously been in. What do I mean by that? Well, the interviewer wants to hear about a specific situation you have been in that demonstrates your competence in the scenario being assessed. The next important element of this tip is in your response, make sure you give details about what you actually did. Now, some people complain that they've never been in the situation before and they therefore cannot answer the question. So if you haven't been in the situation before, my advice is to describe a scenario where you witness someone else doing it, because this shows observational skills. What do I mean by that? Well, let me give you an example answer to a common behavioral interview question. So the question is, tell me about the time you provided excellent customer service. Let's assume you've never been in that situation before. Here's what to say. Although I haven't yet been in that situation, I do know how to provide excellent customer service because I have witnessed others give it. For example, I recently stayed at a hotel with my partner and the service was outstanding. We were immediately welcomed by the hotel reception team or bags were taken to our room. We were given complimentary drinks and refreshments and they contacted us 30 minutes after our arrival to check everything was to our satisfaction. Now, whenever we contacted reception, they answered the phone promptly, politely and professionally, and nothing was too much trouble. I understand how important great customer services to your business and I'm confident I can provide it to your customers in this role and make them feel special. So they use the business again in the future. That is the way to answer behavioral interview questions if you've never been in the scenario before. So let's now move on to tip number two before I give you those 21 brilliant quick answers to difficult behavioral interview questions. Tip number two is, make sure you use the start technique to structure your answers to the behavioral interview questions. Let me quickly tell you what the start technique is. So start stands for situation, task action and result and it's an easy thing to remember when you are answering any type of behavioral interview questions. So you start off your answer and you tell the interviewer the situation you were faced with, you then move on and briefly outline the task that needed doing the task that needed your attention. You then give in-depth details about the action you took to achieve the task and this is where you tell the interviewer what you did and then you finish off and you tell the interviewer the results following your actions. An another important tip is to make sure the result is always a positive one following your action. And you will notice in a second when I give it these 21 quick answers to behavioral interview questions that all of the responses finish on a positive note that is really important. Okay, let's now start working through these quick answers, these easy to remember answers to the 21 most common behavioral interview questions. And the first one is tell me about the time you provided excellent customer service. Here's my example answer that uses a star technique. A customer called our business to inquire about a product we had available. They arranged to come to the company the following day to view the product. My task was to provide them with excellent service when they arrived. As soon as I got off the phone I learned as much about the product as possible so I could answer any questions they had. When the customer arrived the following day I made them feel welcome asked questions to establish their needs and explained everything on you about the product and its benefits. I then answered any questions they had in detail. Now the customer thanked me for my patience and the information I provided before buying the product. So that's a really good easy to remember answer that shows a situation where you provided excellent customer service. Let me now give you the answer, the quick answer, to behavioral interview question number two. Tell me about the time you worked in a team. This is a common question that comes up all the time during all types of job interviews. Here's my example answer. My manager asked the team I was a part of to come up with ideas to help promote a new company product. It was our task to work closely as part of a team to create a list of solid ideas to ensure the product launch was successful. We decided to hold a team meeting and each took turns to put forward ideas while the rest of the team listened and took notes. I suggested we market the product online and others in the group suggested promoting it to our customer database offering a discount. At the end of the meeting we had five great ideas which we presented to our manager. He agreed to implement all the ideas resulting in record sales for the new product launch. That's another really good answer. A quick answer to one of the most common behavioral interview questions. Now don't go anywhere because I still have 19 more behavioral interview questions and answers to give you. But when you're ready you can click that link in the top right hand corner of the video and you can head through to my website pastmaintovue.com and you can instantly download these slides in my full set of 21 quick top scoring answers to the most common behavioral interview questions as a PDF guide. Here's the next question. Tell me about a challenge you had to overcome. Here's my example answer that uses a start technique. Here we go. I worked on a critical time sensitive team project in my previous role. A technical team member went off six, three days before the project deadline. It was my task to find a way to still get the project finished despite being one team member down. I assessed the outstanding workload and allocated some tasks to the remaining team members based on their strengths. Now for the technical related functions I found an online contract to qualify to do the work remotely. By thinking outside the box and acting quickly I overcame this challenge and completed the project on time and to the required standard. You can see how these answers are going to impress any hardening manager. They're really good answers. Here's question four. Tell me about a time you failed. This is a difficult one because the majority of candidates respond by saying, I've never failed. That is not the way to answer this question. This is about how you react to failure. Are you positive? Do you take it upon yourself to improve? Here's my example response. Tell me about a time you failed. When I started my first job I undertook an internal training course, including an exam. Now my task was to partake in the course and achieve a pass mark of 75%. Now unfortunately because I thought I knew the subject very well, I did not study hard enough for the exam and I ended up just failing. I was very disappointed in myself and after apologizing to my supervisor, I studied hard and gained a 97% pass on the retake. I learned a tremendous amount from that experience and I now prepare thoroughly for every situation, task or project I am responsible for. You can see that that ends on a really positive note. You take responsibility for your failure and you improve. That's the most important thing I'm answering that common behavioral interview question. Tell me about a time you failed. Question number five out of all 21. Quick answers to behavioral interview questions is. Tell me about a time when you went above and beyond what was expected here's my example response. In my current job by manager Arstra of Volunteer to cover the work of a colleague who was going to be off sick for three weeks. I volunteered to be that person. It was my task to complete my own and my colleagues worked to the expected standard. I quickly learned my colleagues' duties and responsibilities and prioritise my workload based on the company's needs. By being methodically my task completion, I could go above and beyond what was expected for my manager to help the company while my colleague was off work. That's a really good answer another great answer that will help you be to stand out Canada at your interview is question six. Tell me about a time when you took a calculated risk at work. Well, this is a difficult one. Again, most people say I never take risks. The important thing when answering this common behavioral interview question is to show that you do take risks at times but they are calculated and you assess the pros and cons. Here's my example answer. My manager was off on holiday when I encountered a difficult problem at work. I needed to order a new computer for the office because the old one was broken. However, strict company rules stated managerial permission was required for purchase over $100. I had to decide whether to take the risk and order the computer without the necessary permission. I wrote down a list of the pros and cons of ordering the computer and decided it was the right thing to do. We needed the computer to meet customer demand and to maintain operational efficiency. I took the risk and ordered the computer and when my manager returned to work she agreed I'd made the right decision. That's a great answer because it shows that you are assessing your options, you are writing down a list of the pros and cons and you are acting in the best interest of your employer. Question seven, tell me about the time when you made an unpopular decision. Here's my example answer. I attended a team meeting discussing the project for an important customer. Two team members wanted to cut corners on the project to save money. I disagreed with their suggestion and even though my decision was going to be unpopular I needed to speak out. I explained calmly that cutting corners was unethical and it went against company values. Now if the client found out we had cut corners they would be extremely dissatisfied. Although the team members who wanted to cut corners disagreed with me the rest of the team backed my decision. That's a really good answer because it shows you are not afraid to say something that is unpopular when it's in the best interest of the company. Question number eight, out of our 21 questions and answers don't forget if you are enjoying this tutorial please do hit the like button as you can imagine many many days of preparation goes into making these videos and coming up with a unique answer. All I ask is that you hit the subscribe button and give the video like. Thank you. Question eight, tell me about a situation when you received negative feedback and how you handled it here we go. During a performance review in my previous role my manager criticized me for how long I talked to customers on the telephone. Although I was trying to build positive relationships with our customers it was my task to listen to my manager's feedback and then take steps to improve. Now once we had finished the performance review I enrolled in an online customer service training course to learn additional communication skills to speed up my dealing with customers. Now once the course was finished and I put what I had learned to practice my customer call handling rates improved significantly. That shows that you are a mature and professional employee who responds well to feedback. You don't soak, you're not immature, you take it on board, you listen and then you take the step yourself to improve and there is again that positive outcome. Which is really important when answering behavioral interview questions, question nine. Tell me about the time when you had a conflict with a coworker. Here we go. My colleague and I were working on a project but disagreed on the best approach. I felt it was my task to find a way around the conflict for the sake of the project. I suggested we should compromise by taking the positive aspects of each of our suggested methods of working and combining them together. I also suggested we review our progress more regularly to ensure we were still meeting project expectations and time scales. My colleague agreed. This was a great way forward that suited both of us and as soon as we set to work the conflict disappeared immediately. I'm sure you will agree that that puts you across as the professional work colleague who puts the needs of the project first. You come up with a brilliant idea to get around the conflict again a successful resolution question 10. Tell me about the time when you disagreed with your boss. Now most people say I've never disagreed with my boss and I would never do that's not the way to answer this question. Here's my example response. Here we go. A customer contacted me requesting a refund because they were dissatisfied with their purchase. Now because the customer was one day outside of the permitted refund period, my manager declined their request. I felt this was the wrong decision and so I tried to persuade my manager to allow the refund to go ahead. I explained that the customer was a long standing visitor of the business and we should relax the rules on this occasion because we didn't want to lose their custom in the future. Now after listening to my reasons he decided it was the right thing to do when I was then able to issue the refund to the customer's satisfaction. And I'm sure you will agree that that is a great way to disagree with your boss because it's in the benefits of the customer and the business to do so. Question 11 of our quick answers to the most common 21 behavioral interview questions. Tell me about a time when you improved a process. Here we go. I had concerns in my previous role that our customers had no facility to make suggestions to as for improvement. Being passionate about customer service, I felt it was my responsibility to develop a new way for customers to provide feedback after researching different options. I found a website plugin that we could install on our website that allowed customers to fill in a feedback form once they had made a purchase. Customers had the opportunity to rate their shopping experience and provide written feedback on what they felt we could do to improve. Now after my manager agreed to install the plugin, we started receiving valuable feedback that enabled us to increase customer service standards. This in turn helped to increase sales and customer retention. As another cracking answer, don't forget if you want to download all of these responses. The slides and the PDF guide click the link in the top right-hand corner of the video. Question 12. Tell me about the time when you had to adapt to change. Here's my example answer. In my last job, a new manager took over the running of our department. She was enthusiastic and wanted to make numerous changes to our working practices. Now some team members fought against the changes. But I saw it as my responsibility to embrace them and support the new manager. I listened to the new managers brief and what she wanted us to do. I then learned all the new methods of working and encouraged others in the team to do the same. After four weeks of implementing the new changes, things started to improve and the team was far more productive and efficient than before. Question 13. Tell me about a time when you challenged someone's behaviour. Wow, this is a difficult one. Here's my example answer. I overheard a member of another department making inappropriate comments about a coworker during a break in the campaign. My task was to challenge the person calmly and explain why their comments were unacceptable. I asked them not to use that type of language and that they should show more respect to their coworkers. I also explained that their comments went against company policy and values. And if they use that language again, I would report them to the manager. Now my actions had a positive effect because they apologized and assured me they would never do it again as another top scoring answer. Behavioral interview question number 14. Tell me about a time you helped to co-worker, learn a new skill or develop an existing one. Here's my example response. A co-worker wanted to apply for a promotion but they needed to learn about my job to increase their chances of success. I was happy to help them. And saw it as my duty to teach them what they needed to know. I first assessed their level of knowledge and then put a plan of action in place to teach them. They spent an hour a day with me for a week where I taught them my role and how to carry out each duty to a competent standard. At the end of the week they thanked me for helping them and when they applied for a promotion they were successful. That shows that you are a team player who can coach other people and you are selfless in your duties and have a great answer. Question 15 out of our 21 behavioral interview questions and quick answers. Tell me about a time you had to deal with a difficult customer here we go. A customer came into the store requesting a refund but they didn't have a receipt when I informed them that I could not issue the refund they started shouting at me. It was my task to listen to the customer and take action to diffuse a situation. I let the customer vent their frustrations and while they were talking I listened. I then explained that company policy prevented me from issuing a refund without a receipt. However, I stated that if they reviewed their bank statement when they got home it would probably prove that they purchased the goods from our store which would be a suitable replacement for a receipt. The customer thanked me for this alternative solution and when they returned the next day with their bank statement I was able to issue a refund. That's a really good answer because it shows you are providing excellent customer service. You are sticking to the company rules but you are also providing them with an alternative solution. That's why they're answering so good question 16. Tell me about a time you missed a deadline. Again, most people say I've never missed a deadline but we all missed deadlines. Here's the way to answer it. In my last job my manager gave me a task to work on that included gathering data and information from the previous five years company sales. He stated the task needed to be completed within four to eight hours and despite knowing that deadline would be tight I was eager to meet it. I started gathering the information and data but soon realized the magnitude of the task. Not being deterred. I took some work home with me that evening and spent three hours trying as hard as possible to make good progress. Now despite working additional hours I just missed the deadline. If I had the same task again I would do things slightly differently and delegate tasks to ensure that deadline was met. However, I have no regrets because I gave it my all and I learned a lot about gathering company data and information. Again, a positive end to that situation you are being positive. You are admitting to missing the deadline you were saying I could have done things differently but I gave it my all and that's the most important thing. Question 17. Tell me about the time you've demonstrated leadership skills. Now this question comes out all the time during all types of job interviews not necessarily leadership roles. You can still demonstrate leadership skills even if you do not hold a leadership position here's how. Tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership skills. In my last job I received a call from a local hotel informing me that the company scheduled meeting the following day could not be held due to a flood that had taken place overnight at the hotel. 20 people were due to attend the meeting. I decided to show leadership skills and source a new venue for the meeting. I called around suitable alternative venues in the local area and chose one that was cost effective close to transport links and could provide refreshments during the meeting. Once the venue had been confirmed I informed my manager about the situation and the action I had taken. He thanked me for showing leadership initiative before permitting me to contact all meeting attendees with the updated venue change. That's a great answer because the majority of employees wouldn't do that. They would just go and tell their manager that the hotel had called an ameater than cancelled but you're taking the initiative you're showing leadership skills and sorting out the problem before informing your manager. That's an example of a brilliant top performing employee. Question 18. Tell me about a time you made a mistake here's my example answer. When I first started studying for my exams I spent many hours reading from textbooks. This proved a mistake because my mock exam results were not what I expected to achieve. It was my task to learn from this mistake to improve for my real exams. Immediately following my mock results I analyzed the best way for me to learn and it ended up being through visual infographics and being tested with flashcards. By being positive about my mistake and not dwelling on it I changed how I studied and my exam results improved significantly. That answer speaks for itself. It's a positive way of dealing with a mistake you made a simple mistake. Question 19. Two more to go after this. Tell me about a time you used your initiative to solve a problem here we go. A supplier contacted our company to explain that a product they had been supplying as with was no longer available. This was a problem because we'd sold several of these products to customers overnight. My task was to use my initiative to find an alternative supplier to supply the product moving forward. I researched alternative suppliers and drew a assured list of three suitable companies and then contacted all three companies to obtain quotes and to ascertain delivery times. After speaking to all three companies I chose the one that could provide the best value for money and speed of delivery for our customers. That shows you. You know, resolved to a difficult challenge by showing initiative again you are taking the lead. Question 20. Tell me about a time when you saved a company money. This type of question behavioral interview questions coming up more and more during job interviews because companies want to save money. Here we go. One Friday afternoon I completed my work for the day so I decided to see if I could help the company save money. I was concerned for some time about how much we were paying for office resources so I decided to source a new supplier. I assessed how much we spent each month on resources and contacted several new office suppliers to obtain quotes. Now one of them quoted a saving of more than $300 each month, equating to $3600 per year. I then presented my findings to my manager and he thanked me for my work and then switched to the new supplier. That's another great example. Where you took initiative you'd finish your work one Friday afternoon. Instead of saying I've got no more work you take it upon yourself to look for ways to help save your company money. So I'm about to give you the 21st question. Don't forget if you want to download the answers click the link in the top right-hand corner of the video. Question 21. Tell me about the time when you gave feedback to someone here we go. This is a difficult question. While working in a previous role I noticed a work colleague was making numerous mistakes with their work as their coworker. I felt it was my responsibility for saying something. I needed to use tact and diplomacy to encourage them to improve. I spoke to my work colleague in private and asked them if they were okay to which they said they were. I'd mention their mistakes and asked them why they felt they were making so many. Initially they were defensive but I persevered diplomatically. I encouraged them to change and offered to help them if they were struggling with their work. Now having the confidence to give feedback to my colleague made a massive difference to their work. They never made the same mistakes again and I'm glad that I intervened. That's a great answer because it shows that you are prepared to talk to your colleague given feedback which then resulted in them taking it upon themselves to improve. It's a great result, a great outcome. So the next thing to do is click that link in the top right-hand corner of the video right now.
