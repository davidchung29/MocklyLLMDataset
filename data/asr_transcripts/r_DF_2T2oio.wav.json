Thank you very much indeed. Okay, the first section of this training tutorial is what are competency-based interview questions? Well, competency-based interview questions assess how you have dealt with or how you would deal with common workplace situations. So competency-interview often start with Eva, tell me about a time when you describe a situation when you or given example of when you. So example competency-based interview questions are tell me about a time where you handled conflict in the workplace. So if the hiring manager starts off one of the interview questions as tell me about a time you know you are being asked a competency-based interview question. Another common competency-based interview question is describe a time when you are style of communication improved a situation. That is a really difficult interview questions to answer. Very soon I will give you the perfect response. Another example of a competency-based interview question is tell me about a time when you achieved success even when the odds were stacked against you. So now that we understand what competency-based interview questions are, let's take a look at some example answers. Don't forget we need to give specific situations we have previously been in to prove to the hiring manager that we already have what it takes to excel in the position. So the first competency-based interview question I want to give you an answer to is tell me about a time you handled conflict in the workplace. Here's my top scoring answer to help you pass your interview. In my last job two colleagues argued over the best way to complete a project. Now I could detect the conflict was impacting their progress. So I offered to mediate and find a resolution. I got together with them in private and asked them to outline their project brief and the main cause of the conflict. I encouraged them both to focus on the project goal and write down a list of how they could achieve it in the fastest and most efficient way possible. Now when they brought their collective ideas together in writing they could see the best way to achieve the project goal. They then went on to successfully complete the project without further issue. Getting them to focus on the project objective, not their personal agendas, helped them gain clarity and overcome the conflict. That's a really good example answer to that common but difficult competency-based interview question tell me about a time you handled conflict in the workplace. You are being a responsible and mature employee and you are facilitating a resolution to the conflict of two of your coworkers. It's a fantastic answer. Let's now move on to competency-based interview question number two. This one comes up all the time during job interviews. It's really difficult to answer. Describe a time when you're style of communication improved a situation. Here's my top scoring example answer to help you. I was in a team meeting discussing the plan for a project we were tasked with completing for a valued client. Now two team members suggested that we use a sub-standard product part for the project that was cheaper and would enable us to save project costs. They argued the client would never know about the sub-standard product part and we would increase the project's profit margin. I was opposed to this idea based on safety and moral grounds. When I objected however they said I was being unreasonable. I then changed my communication style to a firmer, more determined at tone. I explained there was a danger to the project safety and morally we had a duty to deliver to the client precisely what they had paid for. After I changed my tone of communication they agreed to disband their idea which was the right decision. That's a really good example answer to that difficult competency based interview question. Describe a time when you're style of communication improved a situation. It also demonstrates that you have really good values. Now please don't go anywhere because I still have more interview questions and answers to give you but when you're ready you can click that link that has appeared in the top right-hand corner of the video head through to my website pacmaintoview.com and you can instantly download these slides plus my full set of 26 great answers to difficult competency based interview questions. It comes in a PDF guide you can have it in your inbox literally within two minutes from now. Here is the next competency based interview question I recommend you prepare for and that is. Tell me about a time when you achieved success even when the odds were stacked against you. Here's my top scoring response to assist you. I worked on a week long project with three team members in my last job. Our manager gave us a responsibility of undertaking an overhaul of the company's website blog and information pages. We allocated different blog categories to each team member based on our writing skills and experience. Unfortunately a team member went off sick after the second day of working on the project. Their absence meant our deadline was in danger of being missed but I wasn't prepared to let that happen. I assessed my absent colleague's writing tasks and decided we could split them among the three remaining team members. I had no plans during the evenings for that week so I volunteered to take on the bulk of the extra writing. By reassessing our plan and allocating tasks accordingly we could still complete the project on time despite the odds being stacked against us. That's a really good answer. I like the fact that you say I wasn't prepared to let that happen. Lots of people would go to their manager and ask for an extension of the deadline but you're not prepared to allow that to happen. You reassess your plan, allocate tasks and you volunteer to take on the bulk of the work. It shows you to be an outstanding employee. It's a great answer. Here is the next competency-based interview question. What's been your biggest achievement to date? Now you can give an achievement from your personal life but where possible give one from your career a previous workplace situation preferably. Here's my top scoring response to assist you. What's been your biggest achievement to date? Here we go. My most significant achievement was in my previous job when the team I was working on achieved the best ever sales for a new company product launch. We got together to brainstorm marketing ideas and once we decided on the best ones we allocated tasks based on team at strengths. I'm very good at posting on social media so my job was to set up advertising campaigns on Facebook and Instagram. Other team members had various tasks including promoting the product to our current database of customers and also creating website blogs highlighting the product's benefits. It was my biggest achievement to date because it was a fantastic combined team effort that surpassed sales targets and all managers' expectations. That's a really good example answer. An example of a brilliant achievement that has helped your employer progress and grow and that's why it's a clever answer to that common competency-based interview question. Here's the next question I recommend you prepare for. Tell me about your time when you supported a work colleague who was struggling. Here is my top scoring response. A new member of staff joined our team and I could tell he was having difficulty using our computer systems and software packages. He was too anxious to ask for help so I spoke to him in private and explained that I had felt the same when I first joined the company. I asked him if he would find it useful if we spent some time together working through the different software packages and he said yes. I then put a plan of action in place of the things I wanted to show him and spent 30 minutes each day during breaks teaching him everything on you. Within two weeks he had reached competence in the position and I gave a copy of the action plan I had used to my manager and suggested we could use it again in the future to teach new staff members. That's a really good answer because you identified that your work colleague was reassured him. You said it's fine because that's how I felt when I first joined the company. You then put a plan of action in place which demonstrates you are organised and methodical. You then spent time during a work break teaching him and then you went to your manager and showed them the action plan so you could use it again when people joined the company. It's a really good answer. Put you across as a selfless employee. It's a really strong answer. Here is the next competency based interview question. I want you to prepare for and that is tell me about a time you dealt with a difficult person. Here's my top scoring response to assist you. When I started to work in my last job, a senior member of the team was difficult to collaborate with. He dismissed my ideas during team meetings and when I asked him for guidance, he was always too busy to assist. However, despite his difficulty, I was determined to build a good relationship. I found out that we both supported the same sports team so I taught him about our shared interest during a work break. His attitude toward me changed instantly. From that day forward, we built an excellent relationship inside and outside of work. I understand the importance of effective collaboration in a team and I will try my hardest to work well with everyone. You'd want to employ someone like that wouldn't you? Somebody who finds a clever and smart way to build a connection with a difficult coworker for the benefit of the company.
