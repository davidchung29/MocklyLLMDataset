Here's an next question. What are the most important skills and qualities needed to be an operation supervisor? Now this interview question comes up often during operation supervisor job interviews. Make sure you read the job description carefully before you attend your interview. Studying the job description will help you to understand what the employer is looking for in the successful candidate. Here's another great example answer. What are the most important skills and qualities needed to be an operation supervisor? Here we go. To be a competent operation supervisor you need excellent planning, organizing and delegation capabilities, delegating tasks to team members based on their strengths is vital if you are to achieve the company's strategic objectives. Outstanding operations supervisors are brilliant communicators and listeners. They can sell their vision to their team, give instructions and messages with total clarity. And they can persuade and influence people to follow their course of action. Other important skills and qualities needed to be a competent operation supervisor include strong leadership capabilities. A versatile style of leadership to suit the situation you are facing critical thinking and problem solving skills and the ability to motivate, lead, a managed teams of people to deliver best value for the company. Another really really good answer that shows you have a thorough understanding of the different skills and qualities needed to be an outstanding operations supervisor. Here's another question. How would you deal with an underperforming member of your team? This is a difficult one. Now underperformance must be dealt with swiftly in your role as an operation supervisor. Make sure you give an answer that demonstrates you already have a set plan you will follow to quickly resolve team member underperformance in your role as an operation supervisor. Here's a great example answer. How would you deal with an underperforming member of your team? Here we go. I will deal with an underperforming member of my team by responding to the situation robustly and swiftly. As soon as I detected there was an issue, I would speak to the team member in private and are sent to explain the reason for their underperformance. Now this would be an important step to take because they may have personal problems they are dealing with or they may feel they haven't received the right training. I would be very surprised if their underperformance was due to a lack of motivation because I am a good motivator and mentor who can get the most out of everyone in a team. Now once I had established the reason for the underperformance, I would put a definitive plan of action in place, including the steps I wanted them to take to make the necessary improvements before monitoring them over the forthcoming weeks to make sure they get back on track quickly. Now as an operation supervisor, if you fail to deal with underperformance quickly, it can affect the entire team's performance and it also sends a message to the rest of your team that you are not a responsive and confident leader. That's a great decisive answer to that common operation supervisor interview question. Here's the next one that I strongly recommend you prepare for. Tell me about a time when you have to make a decision without all the information you needed. This is a really difficult one. It's called a behavioral interview question. So this is a very difficult operation supervisor interview question to answer. My advice is to make sure you use the star technique to structure your answer. So star stands for situation, task, action and result. Let me give you a brilliant example answer that uses a star technique. Tell me about a time when you have to make a decision without all the information you needed. In my last role, I received a request from another company department for a member of my team to join theirs for 14 days to work on an important time-sensitive project. The member of staff was needed due to staff sickness in the other department. I made contact with a department head to ascertain the type of skills they would need, the member of staff to have, however, she was unavailable. So I had to decide which member of staff to send them without all the information I needed. So I called another supervisor in the company who I knew had some knowledge about the project they were working on. Now he informed me that it was a technical web-based project and the majority of team members were competent IT workers and strong communicators. Now once I had this information, I then analyzed the strengths of my team and chose a member of staff to send over who I felt would add value to their project. Whenever I have to make decisions we've limited information. I will try to gather facts from other available sources before deciding on the best course of action that is in the best interest of the company. That's a great answer. It shows that you're not afraid to make a decision without having all the information to hand and you then try to get additional information from other sources. And you then use a logical approach to making the right decision. Here's an next question. How would you motivate your team as an operations supervisor? This is another tough operation supervisor interview question that is assessing your leadership skills. My advice is to talk about the guiding principles you always follow when motivating a team of people toward achieving a company's goals. So use those words in your answer guiding principles. Here's a brilliant example response. How would you motivate your team as an operation supervisor? Here we go. Whenever I motivate a team I always follow six guiding principles. Number one, I conduct performance reviews with each team member of staff to ascertain their strengths, their training needs and their ambitions. I can then motivate my team members based on their individual needs. Number two, I share my vision openly with all team members and I refer to it often during team meetings and discussions because this helps give clarity about the goals we are all working towards. Number three, I will communicate regularly with my team members without micro managing them. I will periodically check they are all okay and I will be on hand to offer advice and guidance when needed. This helps make everyone in the team feel appreciated and supported. Number four, I will create a positive working environment and also recruit a diverse workforce because diversity brings different ideas and opinions which I think is healthy. Number five, I will be honest with my team members and provide feedback and constructive criticism to help them improve because without feedback my team will not move forward. Finally, number six, I will give praise for good work and I will create opportunities for everyone in the team. That's a brilliant answer. And you are referencing six guiding principles whenever you motivate your team. I recommend you learn those because these are great management skills to have when you are undertaking your role as an operation supervisor. Here's an expression. A member of your team fails to complete a task on time and to the required standard who's to blame. Wow, this is a tricky one. Now this question again comes up often during operations supervisor interviews, but if you say the member of your team is the one who's responsible, you could fail your interview. So here's a great example response. A member of your team fails to complete a task on time and to the required standard who's to blame. As the operation supervisor, I would be responsible for this situation. It is my responsibility to lead a monitor my team and to make sure suitable resources and staff are allocated to each task to ensure it is completed on time. And to the expected standard, that's a great answer because it shows that you understand you have ultimate responsibility. It's up to you to make sure everything is done on time and to the required standard. So it shows that you take ownership of everything within your team and your job remit.
