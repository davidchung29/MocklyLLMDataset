If you are applying for any job role with this brilliant organization, make sure you stay tuned because the tips, questions and unique sample answers I am about to give you will help you pass your interview at the first attempt. Just for a quickly, please tell me the name of the position you are applying for at Amazon in the comment section below the video so I can give you some extra tips to help you pass. Thank you very much indeed. Now at your Amazon interview, you will have to answer several different type of questions. The first type of question you will have to answer is called generic and motivational. Questions such as, tell me about yourself, why Amazon, why do you want to work for Amazon, what are your strengths and weaknesses and also what are your career goals. Now once I have explained how to answer these difficult Amazon interview questions, we will move on to the second set of questions which are much harder to answer. And those are called leadership principles questions. But to begin with, let me teach you how to answer the first Amazon interview question, tell me about yourself. I strongly recommend you use my four step structure for answering, tell me about yourself. Don't forget, Amazon will be assessing your communication skills at the interview. So if you give structured answers, it definitely helps you to be successful. Now when you answer, tell me about yourself at an Amazon interview. I recommend you talk about the skills you have that align with the job description. The experience you can bring to Amazon details of any significant accomplishment you have attained in your career. And then finally, the type of person you are and what you will do in your work to help Amazon continue to be successful. You will notice that those four things stand for seat SEAT and you can easily remember my seat structure for tell me about yourself because you will be sat down on a seat at your Amazon interview. And this structure works for all Amazon interviews, whether it's an in person face to face interview, a telephone interview or an online interview. Just remember you are sat down on a seat and they will say to you, tell me about yourself, remember S E A T. Let me now give you a brilliant example, seat structure answer to this first Amazon interview question. Tell me about yourself. Here we go. Thank you for this opportunity to work at Amazon. My top skills which include taking ownership, customer focus, collaboration, innovative problem solving and data driven decision making are a great match for the Amazon job description. I have experienced working on small and large teams, multitasking, launching company products and delivering outstanding customer service. I am a high achiever. In my last position, I helped create a standardized training program for new company highers and I was praised by my manager for how I always asked customers for feedback so we could improve. In addition to being competent in the use of Microsoft Office applications and job-specific software tools, I have completed training courses in health and safety awareness, customer service and artificial intelligence. If you hire me, I will demonstrate the 16 leadership principles in my work, obsess about customers to ensure Amazon remains the industry leader and take on feedback to ensure I add value to my team and I look forward to sharing additional details in the interview, regarding my suitability for Amazon and this position. That is a fantastic structure answer to that first Amazon interview question. Tell me about yourself and you can see how effective my seat structure is. Now don't go anywhere because I still have lots more tips, questions and sample answers to give you, but when you are ready, you can download my brilliant Amazon interview success pack by clicking that link in the top right-hand corner of the video. Let's move on to the second generic motivational Amazon interview question. Why Amazon? Or they might say to you, why do you want to work at Amazon? You must give genuine reasons why you want to work for this fantastic organization. In my opinion, it's the greatest company in the world. Lots of people want to work there, but not necessarily for the right reasons. Good things to say in your answer include the following right these down. The fact that you genuinely believe in their 16 leadership principles. Now earlier on in the video, I said to you that at some stage during your Amazon interview, you will have to answer leadership principles, questions, Amazon has 16 leadership principles. They are core to the organization's success. You need to learn them and understand them before you attend your interview. Later on in this video, I will explain what they are. So you can say you want to work at Amazon because you genuinely believe in their 16 leadership principles. Other good things to say in your answer include the training opportunities Amazon provides employees are fantastic. They really want to help you progress in your career and gain new skills. Finally, you can say how you will get to collaborate on innovative and cutting edge projects while working at Amazon. So that means you will get to utilize your best skills, learn new ones and collaborate with other ambitious and motivated people because don't forget Amazon are always pushing the boundaries to meet the needs of their customers. So let me now give you another brilliant example answer this time to the common Amazon interview question, why Amazon? Here we go. I want to work at Amazon for three reasons. First, you have been the industry leader for several decades and I put that down to your leadership principles. The principles are ones that I believe in and the fact that you push the boundaries of innovation means I will have the opportunity to collaborate on challenging and exciting projects that enhance customers' lives. I will find that aspect of working at Amazon to be very rewarding. Second, you value your employees' ideas. I have a lot to offer the right employer and I'm eager to contribute to a business's success when my ideas are encouraged and trialed, I feel valued in my work. And finally, I want to work at Amazon because you provide excellent skills training opportunities. I am hungry to learn and diversify my skills and my research tells me, Amazon will help me to achieve my professional development goals. That is a very strong answer because you are not just giving one reason why you want to work for this brilliant organization you are giving three. Don't forget to give your answer with passion. Now the second type of question that features in and Amazon interview, these ones are very difficult to answer. They are called leadership principles. Now Amazon, as I previously stated, has a set of 16 leadership principles that are designed to guide decision making, behaviour and company culture at every level of the organization. Now these principles are used to drive consistency across Amazon, influence hiring and promotion decisions and also support customer centric thinking. Let me quickly explain what these leadership principles are and I will then give you some sample questions, a structure to use and some unique responses. So the 16 Amazon leadership principles are as follows. Invent and simplify. This means create new products and services and also make things simple. They are and develop the best people and they also want employees of Amazon to coach a motivate their coworkers. If you can help train a coworker, you should do it. Insist on the highest standards. That principle speaks for itself. You always must aim for the highest standards achievable. All right, a lot. This means you make the right decisions in the best interests of Amazon. I've to be the Earth's best employer. That speaks for itself. Ownership, this is an important leadership principle. It means you take ownership for things. You don't leave problems for other people to deal with. You take ownership of them. Deliver results. Again, that speaks for itself. You always focus on delivering results. You don't put things off. You get things done. Think big. Think bigger than your competitors. Have a big vision. Regality, which means cost consciousness. You look ways not just to increase sales, but to help Amazon save money. Dive deep. This means you analyze information, facts, and evidence to create better decisions. Success and scale bring broad responsibility because Amazon is so big. It has lots of responsibilities and they take those seriously. Learn and be curious. This means that you are always looking to improve. There is always something you to learn. Buyers for action. This means you take action. You take calculated risks. You get things done. Have backbone, disagree, and commit. This means that you are not afraid to challenge people in a calm and professional manner if you think something can be done in an alternative way. You also earn trust. You need to earn the trust of your managers and coworkers. Now you will notice that I have given you 15 leadership principles. There is another one. I believe personally that this next leadership principle is the most important. Now of course everyone who works at Amazon will say all of the leadership principles are just as important as each other. They are correct. But there is one that I believe is absolutely vital. The 16th leadership principle is customer obsession. Amazon obsesses over its customers. For example, I don't work at Amazon. But I love the company. In fact, in the last 12 months alone, I have ordered more than 400 goods and products from Amazon. I think they are brilliant. The reason why I think Amazon are so good is because they make things simple. Their website is easy to use. But more importantly, their delivery is outstanding. I can get things either the same day or the next day. They understand how important customers are to the success of their organization. And that is why they are the market leader, the industry leader because they obsess about their customers. Now when you answer any of the Amazon leadership principles into few questions, I recommend you use the following structure. To begin with, tell the interviewer the situation you were in. You will then move on and explain the task, then you need your attention, then give in-depth details of the action you took to achieve the task and then finish off your answer by telling the Amazon hiring manager the result following your actions. You will notice that that structure stands for star, STAR, CIT, AR, situation, task, action and result. So whenever you answer any of the Amazon leadership principles into few questions, use the star method. Okay, let's start working through some of these leadership principles into few questions. Let's have a look at earn trust. A simple question would be, tell me about your time. You had to influence without authority. This is a difficult question, but it comes up all the time. Tell me about your time. You had to influence someone in your company without authority. This is the leadership principle, earn trust. Let me give you a star method answer and then you will understand how earning trust is vital at Amazon. Here we go. We have to tell you about your time. You had to influence without authority. I attended a team meeting in my previous role to discuss the progress of a project for an important company client. During the meeting, a long-serving team member made the recommendation that we cut corners on the project to save time and money. They argued that the client wouldn't be aware we had cut corners and we could make considerable savings. Several people in the meeting agreed this was a good idea. However, I disagreed. My task was to ask appropriate questions to persuade the meeting that this was a terrible idea with significant risks. I asked the meeting two questions. The first question was, how would we feel if we were the client who had paid good money for a specific service, but later found out that the company had cut corners without consulting us. The second question was, if the client found out that we had not delivered the project as contractually agreed, what damage could be done to our company. My two questions had the desired impact. Everyone quickly agreed it was not a good idea to alter the project specification or timeline, but to find alternative and legitimate ways to reduce costs. That is a really good in-depth answer. You are telling a story about it time. You were able to influence other people without authority. You are not the manager, but you are cleverly asking the meeting questions to change their minds about a course of action. That meets the Amazon leadership principle of earned trust. We have now covered earned trust. Let's take a look at our right a lot. A question will be, tell me about a time when you noted something was off and you fixed it. Tell me about a time when you noticed something was off and you fixed it. Even though this question aligns with the leadership principle of our right a lot, so you make the right decision, you notice something is not right and you do something about it. So meets other leadership principles of again bias fraction, but also ownership. You notice something is wrong and you take ownership to fix it. Let me give you a star method answer. Situation task action and result. Here we go. Tell me about a time when you noticed something was off and you fixed it. In my previous job, I noticed the company had received several negative online reviews via trust pilot. I read the reviews and both customers cited late delivery of their products. Now because I understood how important excellent customer service is to the success of a company, especially in a highly competitive industry, I decided to investigate. I called each customer to apologize and to ask several questions about their experience. The questions I asked were, what delivery time we have promised and how did the experience make you feel about the company? Both customers stated that they had paid for premium fast track delivery, but they had received standard delivery service instead. They also said that they would not use our company again due to a lack of trust. I thank them for their honest feedback, apologize once more and promised to refund their delivery fees. Then started to investigate the issue around premium delivery. I placed an order through our website for premium delivery, but like the customers who complained, I received the standard service. I immediately contacted our career company to request that they investigate the issue. I provided them with three examples of premium delivery failures. After 24 hours, they admitted that a member of their dispatch team had been incorrectly placing premium delivery products in standard delivery dispatch lines. After informing my manager about my findings, we agreed that trust had been lost with the career company. Following the sourcing of a new one on improved terms, customer service improved. As a gesture of goodwill, I contacted the two customers again to explain how the issue had happened and I offered them a 25% discount on their next order. That is another brilliant example answer. You can see our effective, the star method really is for answering leadership principles into view questions. I've still got more questions and answers to give you, but I also have another brilliant product and service that will help you share your Amazon interview.

We have now looked at, earned trust and all right, a lot. Let's now take a look at the next Amazon leadership principles interview question, bias for action. Getting things done. The question is, describe a time you made the right decision despite having limited information. This question features all the time at Amazon interviews, bias for action. Let me give you a brilliant sample answer using the star method. Here we go. Describe a time you made the right decision despite having limited information. In my previous role, I was part of a team, tasked with launching a new company product. A significant amount of time effort and resources, sorry, resources had gone into creating the product and it was our duty to launch it using relevant marketing campaigns that attracted our target audience. We needed to spend time conducting market research to ensure our campaigns would be effective. We'd allocated two weeks for market research. Now unfortunately, we received news that a competitor was about to launch a similar product which resulted in a decision having to be made, whether to stick with our market research strategy or launch immediately. After careful consideration, and understanding the power of being first to market, we decided to bring forward the launch date. We held an emergency team meeting to discuss the best marketing strategies despite having limited information. I suggested we use chatGPT to establish our target audience. The platforms they most frequently use and the different types of adverse we could test for the highest return on investment. Other team members recommended that we use offline marketing methods to boost exposure and also generate free PR. We launched the product 48 hours before our competitor. After seven days, we had exceeded the previous company's best product launch by 17% which was a testament to the team taking a calculated risk to beat our competitors' launch.
