Okay, let's get straight into the tutorial. Before I teach you how to answer behavioral interview questions, let me explain what they are and why hiring managers love to use them. Behavioral interview questions assess how you have performed in previous situations that you will likely encounter in the job you have applied for. The idea being that if you have previously dealt with difficult situations in the workplace successfully, you will also be able to do it again in the job you have applied for. Let me tell you what the most common behavioral interview questions are before I give you my brilliant structure for answering them correctly. The top five most common behavioral interview questions and the ones I recommend you prepare for are, tell me about the time you worked on a team. Tell me about the time you worked under pressure. Tell me about the time you had to overcome a challenging problem. Tell me about the time you made a mistake and tell me about the time you had a conflict with a coworker. When you answer these and other difficult behavioral interview questions you must give a specific situation you have previously been in where you demonstrate the competency that is being assessed in the question. Now there is a recognized structure you must use when answering behavioral interview questions. Let me tell you what that structure is. The best structure to use when answering behavioral interview questions is called the star method. S T A R. The star method is recognized by all hiring managers as the best way to answer difficult behavioral interview questions. So whenever you are answering one of these questions you must start your answer by telling the hiring manager the situation you were faced with. You will then move on and give brief details about the task that needed your attention. You will then give in depth details about the action you took to complete the task before finishing your answer by revealing the results following your actions and it is important to make sure the results are always positive. So let's now start working through my brilliant star method answers to the most common interview questions. Here we go. Behavioral interview question number one is tell me about a time you worked on a team give a specific situation where you collaborated closely with your coworkers to achieve the team's goal. Here is a brilliant star method answer for you to write down and practice. Tell me about your time you worked on a team. During an online sales event our four person team faced a challenge when a supplier ran out of stock for a popular product that had already sold over 100 units. This created an urgent need to find a solution to fulfill orders and manage customer expectations. Our team was responsible for quickly sourcing a new supplier, communicating with affected customers and preventing similar issues in the future. We divided the tasks strategically. I took the lead in researching and contacting alternative suppliers while another team member negotiated pricing and delivery terms. The third team member drafted a clear and empathetic message for customers explaining the slight delay while the fourth team member updated order timelines in our system. We collaborated closely checking progress regularly to ensure alignment and swift action. We secured a new supplier within 24 hours maintained customer trust with proactive communication and established backup suppliers for future events preventing similar issues. That was a brilliant answer and you can see how effective the star method is. Let's move on to behavioral interview question number two which is tell me about a time you worked on the pressure. This question is being asked to assess how you prioritize and organize your work when you are under pressure. Here is my brilliant star method answer. Tell me about a time you worked on the pressure. At my previous company, I stepped in to cover a co-workers duties from another department who was off-sick. This doubled my workload and required me to manage responsibilities across two roles to ensure all tasks and projects were completed on time. My primary challenge was to maintain the same high standards in both roles while meeting deadlines avoiding disruptions to the team and delivering value to the company. To handle the pressure, I prioritised my tasks into urgent, important and non-eurogent categories. I blocked out distractions by setting specific time blocks for focused work, informed colleagues of my availability and worked additional hours in the evenings when necessary. Despite the increased workload, I successfully completed all projects on schedule, maintain quality standards and received praise from my manager for ensuring smooth operations during the co-workers absence. This experience strengthened my time management and problem-solving skills. Behavioral interview question number three we need to cover is tell me about the time you had to overcome a challenging problem. This question assesses two things resilience and problem solving capabilities. Here is my star method answer. Tell me about the time you had to overcome a challenging problem. In my previous role, I noticed that some customers were receiving inconsistent and unprofessional responses from our team which led to a drop in customer satisfaction and occasional negative reviews. It became clear that the team lacked formal customer service training which was causing these issues. I felt it was crucial to address this challenge to ensure our communication met professional standards and helped retain customers. My goal was to find a solution that would improve the team's customer service skills and positively impact the business. I researched various online customer service training courses focusing on those with strong reviews and relevant content. After shortlisting a few, I prepared a proposal for my manager, detailing the benefits of each course and highlighting how improved skills would lead to better customer retention and positive reviews. The training was approved and implemented leading to a noticeable improvement in the team's communication consistency and professionalism. Within a month, customer satisfaction scores rose by 20% and we received significantly more positive feedback from clients. Behavioral interview question number four is a really difficult one to answer. That question is tell me about a time you made a mistake. Do not make the mistake of saying to the hiring manager, I never make mistakes. I have not been in this situation because I am a perfectionist. If you say that, you will fail your interview. The truth is we all make mistakes from time to time, but it is how we react to the mistake that is being assessed with this question. Here is my brilliant star method answer for you to write down and practice. Tell me about a time you made a mistake. In my first job, I was enrolled in an internal training course that was essential for my role. I had some prior knowledge of the subject and, over confidently, assumed I didn't need to study as much as I should have. My goal was to pass the course and demonstrate my competence in the area. However, my lack of preparation led me to just failing the assessment. I immediately took responsibility and apologized to my manager explaining where I went wrong. I asked for the opportunity to retake the course and committed to studying diligently. Over the next few weeks, I made a comprehensive study plan, reviewed the material thoroughly, and sought advice from colleagues who had passed the course. I passed the reset with the high score and gained a much deeper understanding of the subject. This experience taught me the critical importance of preparation which I now apply to every situation at work. Behavioral interview question number five is, tell me about a time you had a conflict with a coworker. Conflict happens in the workplace all the time, but this question is assessing whether you are professional in resolving the conflict and you take responsibility for it to help the team progress. Here is my brilliant star method answer. Tell me about a time you had a conflict with a coworker. In a previous role, a coworker made inappropriate comments about a new team member which I found unprofessional and concerning for the team's dynamic. I felt it was important to address the behavior promptly to ensure our work place remained respectful and inclusive. My goal was to handle the situation professionally while helping my coworker understand the impact of their words. I approached the coworker privately and expressed my concerns calmly and respectfully. I explained why their comments were inappropriate and emphasise the importance of maintaining professionalism and respect in the workplace. When they became defensive, I stood firm, but empathetic, focusing on educating them rather than criticising. After our conversation, the coworker reflected on their behavior, a apologise to me and made efforts to improve. This not only strengthened our team's respect, but also reinforced a positive and professional work environment.
