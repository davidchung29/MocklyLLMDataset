And I will give you some extra tips to help you pass. Thank you very much indeed. Let's start working through those technical job interview questions. Interview question number one is, how would you describe something technical to a non technical person? Let me give you two great tips for giving the perfect answer. Tip number one. Now this question is assessing your communication skills, your ability to communicate complex concepts to people who don't have the same level of knowledge as you. So in your answer, be sure to focus on describing how you would simplify your explanation to help the person better understand. Now in your answer, I strongly recommend you use a practical explanation of how you would describe something technical to someone who does not have the same level of knowledge as you. Here is my brilliant example answer. How would you describe something technical to a non technical person? When explaining something technical to someone who may not have the same background knowledge, I focus on simplifying the concept without oversimplifying it. For example, if I were explaining how the cloud works to a non technical person, I might say think of the cloud like a virtual storage room that you can access from anywhere as long as you have the key. Instead of storing your files on your computer, they're kept in this secure room on the internet. This way, if your computer breaks, your files are safe because they're stored in the cloud. This analogy helps convey the main idea without using complex jargon. I would also make sure to check if the person has any questions to clarify further. So that is a brilliant answer. It's such a good example answer because you are giving an example of how you would explain something technical to a non technical person so they fully understand. Let's move on to technical interview question number two. What problem solving process do you use when encountering bugs and issues? Let me give you two great tips. Tip number one. Problem solving will be a core assessment area in your technical job interview. So I recommend you utilize a five step process whenever solving technical problems. Here is that five step process. Number one, you should always identify and reproduce the issue or problem. Step number two, you then analyze the root cause step number three. You develop a solution step number four. You test the fix and finally step number five. You document the process so people can learn from it and also to make sure it doesn't happen again. So here is my brilliant example answer to technical job interview question number two. What problem solving process do you use when encountering bugs and issues? When encountering bugs or issues, I follow a five step structured problem solving process to identify and resolve them efficiently. In step one, I will identify and reproduce the will gather as much information as possible about the bug. I replicate the issue in a controlled environment to understand its behavior and ensure consistency in its occurrence. Step two, I analyze the root cause. I use debugging tools like logs, breakpoints or error messages to pinpoint where the problem originates. By tracing the code or reviewing system configurations, I narrow down potential causes. Step three, I develop a solution. Once I identify the root cause, I brainstorm and evaluate potential fixes ensuring the solution addresses the issue without introducing new bugs. Step four, I test the fix. After implementing the solution, I rigorously tested in different scenarios to confirm that the bug is resolved and that the system functions correctly. Finally, in step five, I document the process. I document the issue, it's cause, and the resolution steps for future reference, ensuring that the team can learn from the experience. This systematic approach allows me to tackle bugs effectively while minimizing downtime and maintaining system integrity. That is a brilliant answer and if you gave that level of response to me in a technical interview, I would be serious about offering you the position. Now, don't go anywhere because I still have many more tips, questions and sample answers to work through with you, but when you are ready, click the link in the top right hand corner of the video, head straight through to my website to passmaintovie.com and you can instantly download these slides plus my full set of 35 great answers to difficult technical job interview questions. But here is the next question that comes up all the time during technical interviews, but it catches lots of people out. And that question is, how many golf balls can you fit into a school bus? Now, upon the first examination, this seems like a really silly interview question, but there is a reason why lots of hiring managers like asking this question in technical interviews. Here are two important tips. Tip number one, this question assesses your logical thinking and problem solving capabilities. Now, to answer this question, you must make assumptions about the size of the golf ball and the size of the school bus. And tip number two, in your response, describe how you would calculate the volume of the golf ball and the capacity of the school bus before telling the interview at your estimated answer. Always remember, these type of technical difficult interview questions are not requiring you to give the perfect answer. It's about how you approached the problem that is being assessed here. So here is the perfect answer. How many golf balls can you fit into a school bus? I will assume a golf ball is about four centimeters in diameter, which gives it a volume of roughly 40 cubic centimeters. A standard school bus is approximately 10 meters long, two and a half meters wide and two meters tall, giving it a volume of about 50 cubic meters or 50 million cubic centimeters. Since golf balls don't pack perfectly, I'll estimate that only about 70% of the bus's space can be filled with them. So, the usable volume is 50 million times 70% which equals 35 million cubic centimeters. Dividing this by the volume of one golf ball, 35 million divided by 40 equals 875,000. Therefore, you could fit approximately 875,000 golf balls in a school bus. So that is a great answer because you are assuming the size of the golf ball and the size of a typical school bus. So you are approaching the problem in a logical way. Now, if you want to accelerate your learning even further and fully understand how to calculate the volume of a sphere which is a golf ball, you can watch that related video by clicking the link in the top right hand corner at any time during this tutorial. But here is an next technical interview question. I strongly recommend you prepare for. How would you collaborate with a difficult coworker? Again, this question comes up all the time during technical job interviews tip number one. Now, it is common to have disagreements with coworkers in technical job roles, especially when approaching technical based solutions. People who working tech are highly intelligent people. So sometimes there is a clash of personalities and a clash in the decision-making process. Now, in your answer, you must demonstrate an ability to respect your co-workers ideas to help achieve the team's objectives and tip number two. In your answer, demonstrate an ability to resolve conflicts amicably through calm, solution-based discussions that empower the team to achieve its technical goals. Here is the perfect answer. How would you collaborate with a difficult coworker? When collaborating with a difficult coworker, I focus on maintaining professionalism and finding common ground to work effectively. First, I make an effort to understand their perspective by listening carefully to their concerns or preferences. For example, if a coworker prefers a different approach to a task, I would ask questions to understand their reasoning and look for ways to align our goals. If disagreements arise, I keep the discussion, solution, focused, and avoid personal judgments. For instance, I might say, let's focus on the best way to achieve the team's objective, rather than debating who is right. I also ensure clear communication and set boundaries to keep the relationship respectful. Ultimately, my priority is a success of the project and the team, so I aim to foster collaboration through understanding patience and mutual respect. That is a great answer. Technical interview question number five is, why are manhole covers round? This is another silly question, but again, it is being asked for a specific reason. So manhole covers are often found in the road and they are round. They are round for several reasons. But what are those reasons? Let me give you two tips for giving the perfect answer. Tip number one, this technical interview question is common during technical interviews and these assesses your understanding of technical and engineering concepts. Manhole covers are round predominantly because they give greater structural integrity. Tip number two, in your answer, I also recommend you explain how round manhole covers do not fall into the hole, whereas rectangle or square ones can, which can cause dangerous situations. So here is the perfect answer. Why are manhole covers round? Manhole covers are round for several practical and engineering reasons. First, around shape ensures that the cover cannot fall through the opening regardless of how it is positioned. This is because a circle has a constant diameter on like a square or rectangular cover that could call through it if inserted diagonally. Second, around shape is easier to roll, which makes it more practical for transportation and handling by workers. Additionally, circles distribute weight evenly, which enhances their structural integrity when supporting heavy loads like vehicles. And lastly, manufacturing a circular cover is often simpler and requires less precise alignment when placing it back on the opening saving time and reducing potential errors in maintenance. That is the perfect answer to that common technical interview question. Why are manhole covers round? Technical interview question number six, what are the essential skills and qualities needed to work in tech job roles? Tip number one. Now before your technical interview, I strongly recommend, you read the job description. And in your answer, you should talk about technical skills and soft skills. In technical roles to be successful, you must have good, soft and interpersonal skills. Tip number two, in your answer, be sure to include critical thinking, adaptability, collaboration and communication. Here is the perfect answer. What are the essential skills and qualities needed to work in tech roles? Here we go. To work in tech roles effectively, both technical and soft skills are crucial. On the technical side, a strong foundation in problem solving and programming languages like Python, Java or C++ is essential. For mediarity with databases, algorithms and software development tools is also important, depending on the role. On the soft skills side, critical thinking and adaptability are vital, because the tech industry is constantly evolving. Collaboration is key, as most tech projects involve teamwork across different departments. Strong communication skills help explain technical ideas to non-technical stakeholders. And lastly, a willingness to learn and stay updated with emerging technologies is critical to staying relevant and contributing effectively to team projects. Again, that is a brilliant answer. You can see how all of these responses are going to help you post your technical job interview. Technical question number seven, tell me about a time you have to deal with an ethical dilemma. This is a tricky question. Tip number one, ethical dilemmas are common placing technical teams. Now, this question assesses honesty, professionalism and integrity. In your answer, demonstrate your understanding of how important it is to do the right thing. That is what this question is assessing. Your desire to do the right thing in your work. Tip number two, I also strongly advise you use the star method to structure your answer. So, begin your response and outline the situation you were in. You will then talk about the task that needed your attention. You will then give in depth details about the action you took before finally telling the interview at the result following your actions. Here is my brilliant example answer that uses the star method. Tell me about a time you had to deal with an ethical dilemma. Here we go. In a previous role, I was working on a team where I discovered that a colleague had overlooked a crucial step in testing before deploying an update to a live system. Although the colleague assured me it was a minor issue, I knew it had the potential to call significant problems for our clients. I faced an ethical dilemma, whether to report the issue and potentially create conflict with my colleague or let it slide to avoid confrontation. I decided to approach the situation professionally and transparently. I discussed my concerns with the colleague privately, explaining the potential risks and suggesting that we review the deployment together. After our conversation, they agreed to revisit the testing process and we found a bug that could have led to significant downtime. This experience reinforced my belief in the importance of integrity and clear communication in the workplace. Addressing the issue not only prevented a potential problem, but also strengthened our working relationship. That is a brilliant example answer that uses the star method of situation task, action and result is a brilliant response. Technical interview question number eight. How do you handle tight deadlines while working on a technical based project? Tip number one. As you are already aware, you will be expected to manage your workload independently in your tech role. So this question assesses organizing, prioritising and time management capabilities. So in your answer, focus on the following three key areas. Planning, prioritisation and communication. Here is the perfect answer. How do you handle tight deadlines while working on a technical based project? When faced with tight deadlines on a technical project, I focus on planning, prioritisation and communication to ensure successful delivery. First, I break the project down into smaller, manageable tasks and prioritise them based on their impact and dependencies. I often use a traffic light system for prioritisation, red tasks, our urgent and come first. Orange tasks are second and green tasks can be left for later in the working day. This helps me stay organized and focus on what matters most. Second, I utilize project management tools like Jira or Trello to track progress and ensure deadlines are met. Time management is key. So I allocate dedicated time blocks for deep work, minimizing distractions during critical phases of the project. I also ensure clear communication with the team and stakeholders. For instance, if a potential roadblock arises, I inform the relevant parties early to collaboratively find solutions. Finally, I stay flexible and adapt quickly if priority shift or unexpected challenges arise. This approach has consistently helped me deliver high quality work even under tight deadlines. That is a professional brilliant answer that demonstrates your ability to plan, prioritize and complete your work on time while communicating properly. The next question. How do you keep your technical knowledge up to date? Tip number one. Now all technical job roles require a commitment to take ownership of continuous professional development. Now because tech is constantly evolving, make sure you have a plan for how you are going to maintain competence in your work. So here's a different number of things you can do to maintain technical competence. You can subscribe to technical blogs and newsletters, complete online training courses, attend networking events and also participate in online tech communities. Here is the perfect answer. How do you keep your technical knowledge up to date? The tech industry evolves rapidly so I make a conscious effort to stay current. I regularly follow industry news and trends by subscribing to blogs, podcasts and newsletters from reputable sources like TechCrunch, Stack Overflow and GitHub updates. I also take online courses on platforms like Coursera, Udemy and LinkedIn Learning to learn about emerging technologies or enhance my existing skills. For example, I recently completed a course on cloud computing to better understand AWS services. Additionally, I participate in online tech communities and forums such as redits, tech subredits and specialized communities on discord to engage in discussions and learn from other professionals. I also enjoy attending webinars, conferences and meet-ups to network, amgain insights into the latest innovations. This approach helps me stay ahead of changes ensuring I can effectively contribute to projects and bring value to my team. That's a great answer. Technical interview question number 10 that needs a confident answer. What are your salary expectations in this tech role? Let me give you two important tips. Tip number one, it is vital. You research the salary range for your tech role before the interview. Now I recommend you research technical salaries on glassdoor.com. Make sure also you practice your answer several times before the interview so you are confident in the salary negotiation. Now the answer I am about to give you includes several salary figures all you have to do is conduct your own research on glassdoor.com and then alter the figures for your tech job role and industry. Here it is. What are your salary expectations in this tech role? Based on my research and understanding of the role, I believe the salary range for this position typically falls between $65,000 and $75,000 per year. Given my qualifications, experience, proficiency in and then insert any areas of expertise you have, and the value I can bring to your team, I would be comfortable with a salary of $72,000 and the opportunity to have an annual review based on my contribution to the company's commercial objectives for $72,000, I will ensure you receive an excellent return. So that is a really good answer. You have found out, you have researched the salary range and you are then asking for a salary that is just below the higher end of that range and you are justifying why they should give it to you. Don't forget to include in your response the areas of expertise or proficiency you can bring to their team. Now at the end of your technical job interview, you will have the opportunity to ask some questions of your own but which questions should you ask? So the hiring manager will say that's the end of your interview. Do you have any questions for us? Here are the questions I recommend you write down on a sheet of paper, take them with you to the interview and ask them. Here we go. How is the technical team structured and how does this role fit within it? How does the company approach innovation and staying ahead of new technology trends and how does the company support professional development such as training, certifications or attending conferences? That is a great selection of three brilliant questions I recommend you ask at the end of your technical interview.
