      "answer": "Here's my example answer, top scoring answer that uses a star method. Here we go. In my last job, my manager asked the team I was a part of to create a marketing plan for a new company product we were launching. Now the team was responsible for creating a plan that gave the business excellent value for money from its marketing budget and generated the most sales. We started by discussing our target audience. Where and how we could reach them and our marketing message. We each put forward ideas about how we felt we could market the product to get the greatest return. While each team member was speaking, everyone listened and gave encouragement. Finally, we collated the best ideas into a marketing plan before presenting it to our manager. He then permitted us to market the product using the plan and we achieved the best sales for a new product in the company's history. That's a great answer. You're working as part of a team. You're taking it in turns to come up with ideas you are listening to each other and giving encouragement. And you're then achieving a brilliant outcome which is the best sales ever for a new product launch in the company's history. Top scoring answer. Okay, let's now move on to the next question. Wow, this is a really difficult one.",

So start stands for situation, task action and result and it's an easy thing to remember when you are answering any type of behavioral interview questions. So you start off your answer and you tell the interviewer the situation you were faced with, you then move on and briefly outline the task that needed doing the task that needed your attention. You then give in-depth details about the action you took to achieve the task and this is where you tell the interviewer what you did and then you finish off and you tell the interviewer the results following your actions. An another important tip is to make sure the result is always a positive one following your action. And you will notice in a second when I give it these 21 quick answers to behavioral interview questions that all of the responses finish on a positive note that is really important.

For example, I recently stayed at a hotel with my partner and the service was outstanding. We were immediately welcomed by the hotel reception team or bags were taken to our room. We were given complimentary drinks and refreshments and they contacted us 30 minutes after our arrival to check everything was to our satisfaction. Now, whenever we contacted reception, they answered the phone promptly, politely and professionally, and nothing was too much trouble. I understand how important great customer services to your business and I'm confident I can provide it to your customers in this role and make them feel special.",

      "answer": "My manager set aside a large budget to market a new product we would soon launch. Now 100% of the budget had been allocated to offline marketing campaigns, such as magazines, trade shows and radio commercials. I felt this wasn't an effective use of the budget. My task was to convince my manager that the budget could be better utilized with a focus on online advertising. I researched to establish the best online platforms where we could easily reach our target audience and presented my idea to my manager. Now after answering her questions and providing facts and evidence of how we could test the results of our marketing online, she agreed to switch 50% of the budget over to my recommendations. Now four weeks after the product launch, we had evidence to prove my online marketing suggestions gave a more significant return and then the entire budget was switched over.",

      "answer": "As soon as you hear the interview question, start in that way you should automatically think to yourself, I need to use a start technique when answering this question. So start stands for situation, task, action and then result. So let me explain what each of those different elements are. So the hiring manager asks you a behavioral interview question. You start off in you outline the situation you were faced with. So you are actually telling them a story about a situation you have previously been in. You then move on and outline the task that needed your attention. You then move on and give in depth details about the action you took and then finally, finish your answer and talk about the results of your actions. And it's really important to make sure the result is a positive outcome for your team or company. So let me now give you some examples of behavioral interview questions and answers for software engineers that use the start technique. I will tell you where you can download all of the answers. You can see in a second how effective this start technique is for answering software engineer behavioral interview questions.",

So this Amazon leadership principle is based on fruit gallery. So question number two, read the following information before choosing your answer. You are working in an office and you feel the way office supplies are ordered is ineffective. Everyone in the team has the power to order office supplies as and when they need them. This results in several deliveries each week to the office which is costing the company expensive curry of fees.",

Now I believe Amazon is probably the best organization in the world. They are a fantastic employer and therefore competition is fierce.

You should also again mention Amazon's 16 leadership principles and how these will be the foundation of your work as a business analyst.

      "answer": "This is the video and there is a link right there at the top of this video that if you click that it will take you through to another video right here on YouTube where I talked to you about the importance of the Amazon leadership principles. It's my opinion that you will not pass your interview for Amazon as a process assistant unless you learn and understand the 16 Amazon leadership principles. They are absolutely crucial to all employees who work at Amazon in my opinion. Amazon is one of the greatest companies in the world. And primarily that is because they have the 16 leadership principles that they want everybody to demonstrate in their work. Make sure you check that out. Finally, again don't forget to subscribe to the channel. It's really important. I want to help you not just pass every job into view you ever attend but also help you progress throughout your career. I can only do that if you are subscribed please also give the video a like. That is all I ask. It just tells me that you find these tutorials useful and also don't forget to connect with me on LinkedIn. I've put my LinkedIn link in the description below the video and it's always really good to connect with light-minded professionals such as yourself. Thank you so much for watching and I wish you all the best for passing your Amazon process assistant job interview have a brilliant day.",

It was my task to be patient with a customer reassure them and walk them through the online payment process. I listened patiently to the customer's concerns, asked them questions and taught them clearly through every step of the ordering process, making sure they fully understood everything I was saying. Now although the call took much longer than expected, the customer successfully placed their order and they thanked me for being patient and reassuring them throughout the process.",

Lots of people respond to that tough behavioural interview question by saying they would never disagree with their boss because their boss is the person who is in charge. However, this question is assessing your confidence and communication skills to see whether you would disagree if you think there's a better alternative that will help the company. That is a great answer. The next behavioural interview question I had to answer in that live job interview was tell me about a time you delivered excellent customer service. This question comes up all the time during job interviews. Don't forget to give a specific situation you have been in. Or if it's your first job interview, tell them what you would do to deliver excellent customer service. Here is the exact answer I gave that uses a star method. Here we go.",

So that statement shows that you are applying the leadership principle of frugality. Now statement number one says I will not take calculated risks when making important decisions but that goes against the leadership principle of bias for action which is value speed take calculated risks but that says not take calculated risks. So that one is not applicable to me because I want to demonstrate those leadership principles again you can see why it is so imperative you learn and understand those leadership principles take calculated risks.

We got together to brainstorm marketing ideas and once we decided on the best ones we allocated tasks based on team at strengths. I'm very good at posting on social media so my job was to set up advertising campaigns on Facebook and Instagram. Other team members had various tasks including promoting the product to our current database of customers and also creating website blogs highlighting the product's benefits. It was my biggest achievement to date because it was a fantastic combined team effort that surpassed sales targets and all managers' expectations.",

It really helps to paint a picture of who you are as a person. I think what you need to be careful of and what is a common mistake is to not just reiterate everything that they're looking at on your resume. So once you started to get into that I'm at this type of major and that I did this job and before that I did that job, all you're doing is reading your resume to them and they've already read your resume. That's why they brought you in as a candidate. So you kind of have to think about what your pitch is and what your story is and what is it that I want them to know within the first few minutes of meeting me. And that's really hard. This isn't something that's an easy thing to do but you want to just try to stay away. And you actually did a good job. I would say you weren't. I've had, you know, I, well, I'm from Franklin Mass and I went to such and such high school and then I went to Curry College and then I did this job and you didn't do that which was good. But you want to try to stay away from what I kind of would describe as like the chronology of your background and more as a summary of who you are as a candidate, what you're looking for, where your passion lies as it relates to the position.",

So very soon I will give you another example answer to a different Amazon leadership principle but first of all let me give you Amazon interview tip number two. Amazon interview tip number two is to make sure you use the start technique when answering the leadership principle interview questions. So you will have noticed in the previous answer that I just gave you I used what is called the start technique to structure your response. It's a brilliant format to use during your Amazon interview. It's important because it enables you to provide specific evidence of where you are matching the leadership principle. So the start technique stands for situation task action and result. You start off your response to the interview question by explaining the situation you were faced with. You then move on and tell the interviewer the task that need you doing and you will then go into detail and explain the action that you took. This is where it's important that you tell the interview exactly what you did and the reasons why you did it and you then finish off with the results following your actions and it's really important to make sure the results are positive. So Amazon interview tip number two is to always make sure you use the start technique situation task action result when responding to the Amazon leadership principles interview questions. Amazon interview tip number three is to be prepared for probing questions. Well all Amazon hiring managers are very, very good at their jobs. They are trained to ask the right questions and to delve a bit deeper into your responses to ask to take your intentions and the skills and qualities you have that will enable you to be a high performing Amazon employee. So probing questions will always come after you have given a response to an interview question. Examples of probing questions include why did you approach things that way?",

      "answer": "A situation occurred recently at work where by I noticed a colleague of mine carrying an extremely heavy item of equipment without using the correct manual handling techniques. I was genuinely concerned for their safety as an injury could put them out of action for many months and it would also cost the company money due to being sure staff. I saw it as my task to speak to my work colleague about this safety issue and to also make sure everyone in the team was aware of the correct manual handling safety procedures to follow. So I spoke to my work colleague in private to explain the danger they were putting themselves in and to ask whether or not they had received the correct training when they joined the company. Now they informed me they had received the training but they had since forgotten what it entailed. So I decided to speak to my supervisor to ask if we could all have some refresher training to remind us of the correct manual handling techniques to use as this would help prevent injuries moving Now the end result was that my supervisor agreed it was a great idea and we've been seven days we had all received an hour long training session which was going to be repeated every six months.",

Now, unfortunately, because I was busy with other important tasks, I failed to thoroughly check the finished blog. When I submitted it to my supervisor, she highlighted several grammar mistakes. I was very disappointed because I'd let myself, my team and my supervisor down. After apologizing, I rewrote the blog and ran a thorough spell and grammar check before resubmitting my work for approval. Now, I learned a lot from that mistake, and I now always check everything thoroughly to make sure it is perfect.",

      "answer": "Thank you very much indeed. Now at your Amazon interview, you will have to answer several different type of questions. The first type of question you will have to answer is called generic and motivational. Questions such as, tell me about yourself, why Amazon, why do you want to work for Amazon, what are your strengths and weaknesses and also what are your career goals. Now once I have explained how to answer these difficult Amazon interview questions, we will move on to the second set of questions which are much harder to answer. And those are called leadership principles questions. But to begin with, let me teach you how to answer the first Amazon interview question, tell me about yourself. I strongly recommend you use my four step structure for answering, tell me about yourself. Don't forget, Amazon will be assessing your communication skills at the interview. So if you give structured answers, it definitely helps you to be successful. Now when you answer, tell me about yourself at an Amazon interview. I recommend you talk about the skills you have that align with the job description. The experience you can bring to Amazon details of any significant accomplishment you have attained in your career. And then finally, the type of person you are and what you will do in your work to help Amazon continue to be successful. You will notice that those four things stand for seat SEAT and you can easily remember my seat structure for tell me about yourself because you will be sat down on a seat at your Amazon interview. And this structure works for all Amazon interviews, whether it's an in person face to face interview, a telephone interview or an online interview. Just remember you are sat down on a seat and they will say to you, tell me about yourself, remember S E A T. Let me now give you a brilliant example, seat structure answer to this first Amazon interview question.",

They argued that the client wouldn't be aware we had cut corners and we could make considerable savings. Several people in the meeting agreed this was a good idea. However, I disagreed. My task was to ask appropriate questions to persuade the meeting that this was a terrible idea with significant risks. I asked the meeting two questions. The first question was, how would we feel if we were the client who had paid good money for a specific service, but later found out that the company had cut corners without consulting us. The second question was, if the client found out that we had not delivered the project as contractually agreed, what damage could be done to our company. My two questions had the desired impact. Everyone quickly agreed it was not a good idea to alter the project specification or timeline, but to find alternative and legitimate ways to reduce costs.",

      "question": "Tell me about a time when you had to manage conflicting priorities.",
      "answer": "Now this is undoubtedly one of the hardest interview questions to answer correctly but if you have a job interview coming up for any role or any organisation stay tuned because I will give you the perfect answer. And just very quickly if you are new to the channel please do make sure you hit the subscribe button because I can then keep you updated. We've all the latest interview tips and top scoring answers and please give the video a like. That tells me you find these tutorials useful. Thank you very much for your support. Let's jump straight into the presentation. So to help you pass your interview I will cover three things during this tutorial. Number one I will explain why the hiring manager is asking you the interview question tell me about a time when you had to manage conflicting priorities. Number two I will explain how to structure your answer to gain the highest scores possible and number three I will give you two example outstanding responses. So to begin with why is the interview are asking you the question tell me about a time when you had to manage conflicting priorities. Well number one the role you are applying for will require you to manage multiple important tasks and priorities. Now if you already have experience of managing conflicting priorities you are definitely going to be a good fit for the role. And number two if you are able to manage conflicting priorities it tells the interviewer you are organized resilient and you are the type of person who will never crumble under pressure. Now before I give you two top scoring answers let me tell you how to structure your response to the difficult interview question tell me about a time when you had to manage conflicting priorities. Now my advice is to use the start technique to structure your answer. So you start off a new telly interviewer the situation you were faced with. You then move on and explain the task that needed doing. You then give specific details about the action you took before finishing off with the results of your actions. So let me now give you two example answers to the interview question tell me about a time when you had to manage conflicting priorities. Please tell me in the comments section below the video which answer option you think is the strongest. Here's example number one answer option number one tell me about a time when you had to manage conflicting priorities here we go. In my previous role I volunteered to help out on a project that was in danger of failing. Now in addition to this work I also had my regular duties to complete. It was my task to successfully manage all conflicting priorities to ensure everything was finished on time. I started out by speaking to the team members who were working on the failing project. I assessed the priorities of this project and suggested ways I could contribute to the team's objectives. I also analyzed my own workload and I drew up a list of which tasks were urgent and how long they would take me to complete. This gave me a perfect picture of the work I needed to do for both the project and my own responsibilities. Now to manage the conflicting priorities I stayed behind late for an hour each day after work and I met up regularly with the project team members to ensure progress was being made and that we had the necessary resources to get everything finished. Now after two weeks of working on the project and by prioritising my own task I was able to effectively manage all conflicting priorities much to the satisfaction of my manager. Example answer number two tell me about a time when you had to manage conflicting priorities here we go. In my previous job my manager asked for a volunteer to do the work of a team member who was going to be off sick for several weeks. I volunteered to be that person. It was my responsibility to manage both my own workload and the workload of my coworker to ensure all conflicting priorities were managed effectively. I started out by drawing up a list of the responsibilities I would have for both roles putting each task in order of priority. I then calculated how much time each task would take to complete and I set to work. I dealt with all customer service responsibilities first as I felt these were the priority before taking care of administrative duties answering internal queries, responding to emails and maintaining stock levels. To prevent deadlines from getting missed I stayed behind late after work as and when required. By using a structured approach to all tasks and responsibilities I'm by being flexible with my working hours I was able to successfully manage all conflicting priorities. So there is two brilliant example answers to that really difficult interview question.

This question is assessing two things. Number one, honesty. Because we all make mistakes but you have to be honest about them. So give the hiring manager an example of when you made a mistake and you owned up to it. This question also evaluates your desire for self-improvement. So in your answer, tell the hiring manager what the mistake was, say that you took ownership of it and you then worked hard to self-improve. Here is my brilliant example response.",

      "answer": "During the holiday season in my previous retail role, our store experienced an unexpected surge in foot traffic resulting in long cues and a shortage of staff. My task was to manage the situation efficiently ensuring customers had a positive experience despite the challenges. I quickly prioritised tasks, delegating responsibilities to available staff members and stepping in to assist with customer service. I also communicated with customers in the queue, offering updates and providing small gestures like complementary refreshments to ease their frustration. Until, tangiously, I contacted part-time employees to see if they could come in on short notice. The situation was managed effectively and several customers complimented our team's professionalism despite the pressure. Sales for the day exceeded expectations and customer satisfaction remained high.
