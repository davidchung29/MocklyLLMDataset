{"question": "Tell me about a time when you influence the change by only asking questions.", "answer": "This is a difficult Amazon interview question. Tip number one. This question is an example of an Amazon behavioral interview question. You will have to answer several of these questions during your Amazon interview. Now it is important to give a specific situation where you demonstrated the scenario being assessed."}
{"question": "Tip number two, I also strongly recommend you use a star technique to structure your answer but what is the star technique?", "answer": "Let me quickly tell you what it is and I will then give you an example answer. So the star technique stands for situation task action and result. You start off your answer and tell the interview with a situation you were faced with. You then move on and briefly outline the task that needed doing. You then give in depth details about the action you took to achieve the task and then finally you finish off your answer and reveal the results following your actions and it's really important to make sure the results are positive following the action that you took. So let me now give you an example answer to that question."}
{"question": "Tell me about a time when you influence to change by only asking questions that uses the star technique and you can see how effective it is at helping you to structure your answer to Amazon behavioral interview questions.", "answer": "Here we go. I was in a team meeting discussing the workflow for a new project which was for a client of the company. Now two team members suggested we should use a cheaper product part for the project that would save us considerable money on the project costs and make it more profitable. They argued the client would have no idea we were using a sub-standard product part so it wasn't an issue. Now I was not comfortable with this situation because it went against our company values and it was morally wrong. So it was my task to challenge them by asking questions. I asked a team members two questions to influence their proposal. I asked them if they felt their suggestion was in line with our company values and how we were expected to treat our clients with honesty and integrity. They agreed it wasn't. I then asked them what would we do if the project failed later on down the line because of the sub-standard product part and the client then found out. I explained that the situation could be immensely damaging to our reputation to which they agreed. After putting the two questions to them they agreed it was not a good idea and we should stick to the original agreed project specification. So that's a really good answer that will help you pass your Amazon interview and you can see how effective that start technique really is helping you to give a powerful answer. Let me give you another example, Amazon behavioral interview question that uses a start technique. And that question is tell me about a time when you had to overcome a difficult challenge in the workplace. Here's my example answer to help you. When I first started working my previous role I encountered a difficult coworker. He had been with the company for many years and because I was relatively young and enthusiastic I got the impression he didn't want to help. I'd asked for his assistance and guidance on a couple of issues but he wasn't forthcoming with information. So I saw this as a challenge and it was my task to break down his barriers and get to work with him closely so I could benefit from his knowledge and expertise which would then help me to do a good job for the team. I decided to change my approach and after I found out that we both supported the same football team I started to talk about our shared interest during a work break. Now this proved to be a good move because he spoke passionately about the team we both supported and this enabled me to build a positive rapport with him. Several days later when I next asked him for guidance on a project I was working on he was more receptive and happy to advise and from that day on we became close and productive work colleagues which I believe was down to my strong communication and interpersonal skills. So that's a really good in-depth answer to that Amazon behavioral interview question tell me about when you had to overcome a difficult challenge in the workplace and it uses a start technique to great effect you can see how by learning the start technique it will really help you to get an advantage at your Amazon interview. Here's the next question."}
{"question": "What are your strengths and weaknesses?", "answer": "Now again this is a common Amazon interview question that I recommend you prepare for. Try to align your strengths to the key skills and qualities that are listed on the Amazon job description and tip number two for the weakness part of your answer is important to demonstrate self awareness so do not say you don't have any weaknesses because you might then fail your interview. Here's my example answer."}
{"question": "What are your strengths and weaknesses?", "answer": "My strengths include my ability to work at pace to complete all work to exacting standards to organize and prioritize my work in line with my employers goals and in fact now I always take responsibility of my own professional development. Other strengths include my strong interpersonal skills, my desire to carry out tasks and duties outside of my job description because I am passionate about learning new things and my willingness to help train up new members of staff whenever they join the team. Now my weakness is the fact I find it difficult letting go of projects. I tend to spend too long checking over completed projects to see if improvements can be made but I need to learn to let finish to projects go and move on to the next one and this is definitely something I am working hard on to improve. That's a really good answer again that's going to help you. I'll share your Amazon interview at the first attempt. Here's an next question."}
{"question": "Why should we hire you to work at Amazon?", "answer": "Tip number one this is another tough but common Amazon interview question that needs a confident answer."}
{"question": "Don't just give one reason why they should hire you to work at Amazon.", "answer": "Think of several reasons that demonstrate you can add value to the organization in the position you have applied for so here's my example answer."}
{"question": "Why should we hire you to work at Amazon?", "answer": "Here we go. You should hire me because I have the experience and knowledge to excel in this role. This means I will contribute positively to Amazon's long-term vision and I will be a positive role model for the organization whilst helping customers and interacting with co-workers clients and stakeholders.

Finally you should hire me because I am very much open to learning and I am a big advocate of change. I know that Amazon must always change and respond to the needs of its customers if it is to continually be the market leader and I will always support you in that change. That's a really good answer another cracking answer that will help you pass your interview with confidence. Here's the next question."}
{"question": "Tell me about a time when you demonstrated one of the leadership principles in the workplace.", "answer": "This is a difficult question to answer correctly. So it's one of the toughest Amazon interview questions in my opinion. My advice is to make sure you learn the 16 Amazon leadership principles before you attend your interview. Now I have placed links in the description below this video to several tutorials right here on YouTube where I teach you the leadership principles and also give you several additional leadership principles into view questions that I recommend you prepare. So make sure you check those out once I have given you the answer in a second. Tip number two at the start of your answer to this question. Tell the interviewer which leadership principles your answer relates to. Let me give you my example response."}
{"question": "Tell me about a time when you demonstrated one of the leadership principles in the workplace.", "answer": "Here we go. I recently demonstrated in my last job the leadership principle of have back-bone disagree and commit. A customer wanted a refund but their reason went against the company's refund policy. They were two days over the time limit to qualify for a refund but I felt the company should honor it anyway because the customer was not satisfied with the product and I felt it was more important to give exceptional service as they would then hopefully use the company's products again in the future."}
{"question": "However, when I asked my manager for permission to give the refund, he said no.", "answer": "I disagreed with him and explained by reasons why but he still refused. So I then accepted his decision and informed the customer politely and professionally of the fact that I was not able to refund their order. I am not afraid to disagree with a manager. If I think something could be done better to the benefit of the company but I would always commit to their decision if they said no. So that's my example answer to that tough Amazon interview question."}
