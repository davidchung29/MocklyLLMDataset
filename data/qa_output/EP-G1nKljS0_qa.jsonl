After sending it, I realized it contained several spelling and grammar errors. Since this email reflected both my professionalism and the company standards I knew I had made a mistake. It was my responsibility to ensure all client communications work clear, professional and error-free. I needed to address the situation immediately to maintain the client's confidence in our company. As soon as I realized the mistake, I took ownership of it. I promptly sent a follow-up email to the client, apologising for the errors and attaching a corrected version of the message. Additionally, I called the client to acknowledge the mistake personally, reassure them of my commitment to high communications standards, and ensure they had the correct information. To prevent this from happening again, I installed the Grammally Chrome extension for Gmail, which helped me catch spelling and grammatical errors before sending any future emails. The client appreciated my prompt response and professionalism in handling the situation and our business relationship remains strong. Implementing Grammally significantly improved the accuracy and professionalism of my emails, ensuring that such mistakes did not happen again. So that is another really good example answer, and it shows that you take ownership for your mistakes, you are honest about them, but more importantly, you take steps to learn and improve so they don't happen again.
