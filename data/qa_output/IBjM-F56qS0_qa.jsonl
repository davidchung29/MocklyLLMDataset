But here's the next question for you."}
{"question": "Tell me about a project you completed successfully tip number one.", "answer": "Now this question is assessing your ability to complete software engineering projects successfully as you know you need project management skills as a software engineer. So my advice is to give a specific situation where you have to overcome an unexpected problem to complete a project on time. Tip number two, this is a good tip. Make sure you use a star technique to structure your answer to this behavioral interview question. So this type of question where they say to you, tell me about a time or describe a situation is called a behavioral interview question. Now before I give you my example answer let me explain what the star technique is. So the star technique stands for situation task action and result. So you start off your answer and you outline the situation you were faced with. You then move on and talk briefly about the task that needed doing. This shows awareness of what you are supposed to do during the situation. You then give specific details about the action you took to complete the task before finishing off with your results."}
{"question": "What was the result following your action?", "answer": "So you finish off your answer with the results following the action that you took. So it's a great technique to use when answering software engineer behavioral interview questions. Let me now give you my example answer to that question using the star technique so you can see how effective it is."}
{"question": "Tell me about a project you completed successfully.", "answer": "I was working on a challenging time sensitive software engineering project for my previous employer. There were six of us in the team and each one of us had different skills that we brought to the project. Unfortunately two weeks before the project deadline two team members went off sick including the project leader. There were no other software engineers available in the organization and I wasn't prepared to extend the deadline. Therefore it was my task to come up with a new plan of action to get things finished. So the remaining four of us got together to discuss our options. I suggested we should absorb whatever tasks we could amongst ourselves and then outsource the remaining technical tasks to a competent software engineer using the website upwork.com. Now this proved to be a smart move because after hiring the replacement software engineer online the project was still completed on time and to the expected standard. That's a brilliant example answer that uses the star technique to answer that behavioral interview question. Here's the next interview question I recommend you prepare for."}
{"question": "What are the most important skills and qualities needed to be a great software engineer?", "answer": "Now the question is assessing whether you have read the job description. If you haven't read the job description you can't answer this question confidently. Now my advice is to really make sure you read the job description carefully before your interview because it outlines the skills and qualities the employer is looking for. TIT number two I also recommend referencing technical interpersonal and soft skills in your answer. Here's my example response."}
{"question": "What are the most important skills and qualities needed to be a great software engineer?", "answer": "Here we go. To be effective as a software engineer, various technical, interpersonal and soft skills are a must. You need excellent computer programming and coding skills, software testing and debugging competence, problem solving capabilities and critical and logical thinking skills. You need excellent team working and collaborating abilities, strong communication and listening skills and the ability to explain complex information in simple terms to non-technical individuals. As a software engineer you need to take responsibility for your ongoing professional development, possess emotional intelligence, be self-aware and open-minded and have outstanding time management capabilities. To excel as a software engineer you must be commercially aware, be self-motivated and disciplined and be able to work both independently and as part of a team. That is a brilliant example answer to that common question."}
{"question": "What are the most important skills and qualities needed to be a great software engineer?", "answer": "You can see how all of these answers are going to help you to be the standout candidate at your interview. Here's the next question."}
{"question": "Why should we hire you as a software engineer?", "answer": "This is another common software engineer interview question that requires a confident answer because your response could be the difference between a past or fail. I recommend referencing their organizational values in your answer. And how you will share your expertise and knowledge with other people in the team. Here's my example response to help you be the standout candidate."}
{"question": "Why should we hire you as a software engineer?", "answer": "Here we go. You should hire me as a software engineer because I'm motivated by your organizational values. I am commercially aware which means everything I do will be geared towards helping you achieve your commercial objectives and I will share my knowledge and expertise willingly with other people in the team. You should also hire me because I am passionate about self development and ongoing learning. So this means you will be hiring a software engineer whose skills and competencies will always be relevant and up to date and whose knowledge will enhance and complement the team that I will be a part of. That is a brilliant example answer to that common question."}
{"question": "Why should we hire you?", "answer": "There's going to help you be the standout candidate. Here's the next question."}
{"question": "How would you explain something technical to a non-technical person?", "answer": "This is a difficult one. Now this common software engineer interview question is assessing your communication skills. I strongly recommend preparing an answer to this question. In advance of your interview simply because you can't sit there and think for long about your answer you should know quickly how you would explain technical concepts to non-technical people in the role. So here's my example answer to help you."}
{"question": "How would you explain something technical to a non-technical person?", "answer": "Here we go. To begin with I would assess their knowledge by asking them questions to gauge where they were from a technical perspective. I would make sure I avoided technical jargon when describing anything technical. I would use visual drawings and diagrams to explain technical concepts and I would use familiar objects, scenarios and terminology to explain what it was. I was trying to describe. I would explain everything to them more than once and I would ask quiz-based questions to ensure they fully understood my explanations. Finally, I would leave ample time for the individual to ask me questions and I would make sure I answered them clearly and concisely. So if you give that answer quickly straight away after that question is asked, it shows that you have the communication skills and the style of communication, the adaptable style to tailor for everyone's needs, especially people who have limited technical knowledge. Here's an next question."}
{"question": "What's your biggest weakness now?", "answer": "This question catches a lot of candidates out. Tip number one, again this question is going to come up at some stage during your software engineer interview. Now some people think it's right to say they don't have any weaknesses, but that answer will score zero points. Conversely, if you give a weakness there is a match for the job description and you can see why it's so important to read it, you will not get hired."}
{"question": "Tip number two, instead give a weakness that is not a requirement of the software engineering role you have applied for, but which weakness do you give?", "answer": "Well, let me give you some example weakness is so good weaknesses you can use. Now we'll then give you my preferred answer. So here's some example weaknesses for software engineer interviews. Number one, you could say you find it hard letting go of projects. Number two, you could say you don't like giving people on a speedback simply because you are non-confrontational. Number three, you could say you don't like asking people for help or advice. You prefer to figure things out for yourself, which can take more time and that's the reason why it's a weakness or number four, you could say you are too self critical or too hard on yourself at times. So let me now give you my preferred example weakness to this tough interview question."}
{"question": "What's your biggest weakness here we go?", "answer": "My biggest weakness is the fact I'm not yet very good at public speaking or giving presentations to large groups of people. Although my weakness will not affect my ability to perform competently as a software engineer. If there are any opportunities in your organization to develop my public speaking skills then I would like to give it a try. That's a brilliant answer. You are giving a weakness that will not affect your ability to perform your duties as a software engineer competently, but you are saying you do want to improve. So if there are any opportunities you would like to give it a try and that shows confidence and a willingness to learn, improve and develop, which is important in the role.
