{"question": "But the question states which of these inquiries would you respond to first?", "answer": "Now this is a difficult question to answer."}
{"question": "However, if you understand those Leadership Principles, you will know which one the you need to respond to first.", "answer": "So let's take a look at them and then I will get you to answer this question by putting your response in the comment section below the video. So let's have a look. The first one is called an urgent, unfulfilled audit. You start work and these five inquiries are in your email inbox. And this one says, it's from a customer. I placed an order for a laptop two weeks ago and it still hasn't been delivered. This is urgent. I need it for work. Please assist ASAP. Now the second customer inquiry is called a product inquiry. So the customer has said to you, hi, I am interested in buying a laptop. But I need help comparing different models."}
{"question": "Can you provide detailed specifications for laptops, A, B and C?", "answer": "The next customer inquiry is a return and refund request. I received a damaged phone case. I would like to return it and get a refund. Please guide me through the return process. The fourth customer inquiry is called Account Access Issue. I can't access my account. It says my password is incorrect. But I haven't changed it. Please help me regain access to my account. And the fifth customer inquiry that you have to deal with is called feedback and suggestion. And it says, I have some feedback and suggestions about your website's user interface."}
{"question": "Is there a way I can share my thoughts with the development team?", "answer": "Okay, so those are the five customer inquiries you have to deal with."}
{"question": "But the question is, which of those inquiries would you respond to first? Would you respond to A, the urgent unfulfilled order? B, that product inquiry, C, the return and refund request, D, that account access issue, or the feedback and suggestion?", "answer": "So please tell me which answer option you would respond to first, A, B, C, D, or E."}
{"question": "Tell me in the comments section below the video.", "answer": "I will come on a each day and mark your answers for you. You've got 10 seconds to put your answer in the comment section below the video. Here we go. Okay, well done. And don't forget, the 16 Amazon leadership principles, customer obsession. Question number two, try another answer."}
{"question": "This time, question two is, which of the inquiries would you respond to last? B, C, D, or E? Tell me your answer in the comment section below the video.", "answer": "Here's your 10 second timer."}
{"question": "Don't forget, customer obsession is one of the leadership principles and you have to act decisively.", "answer": "Okay, let's now move on to a different type of Amazon assessment test, practice question. This is called a work style assessment test. Now, this test, assesses that your work style is in line with Amazon's leadership principles. So again, you can see why it is so important that you learn, understand and demonstrate these leadership principles in your work. So work style assessment test question number three. Now we are given a statement. My emphasis on making customers feel valued and delivering excellent service outweighs my focus on outperforming competitors. And we are given some options."}
{"question": "Do we a strongly agree with that statement?", "answer": "Be agree with it. See, neither agree or disagree. D disagree or E strongly disagree. Now, I would choose strongly agree."}
{"question": "Why would I choose that answer?", "answer": "I would choose it because of the customer obsession leadership principle, which says, start with a customer earn their trust and obsess over their needs. So that's exactly how I would answer that question. And again, you can see why it is so important to learn and understand those leadership principles before you undertake your Amazon assessment test. Because you're making the customer feel valued and you are delivering excellent service. And that is more important to you than your focus on outperforming competitors. The reason being, if you deliver brilliant outstanding service, customers will come back to you time and time again and you will by default beat your competitors. So now it's your turn to try some. Work style assessment test question number four. Whenever I have an idea during a team meeting, I will either a, put forward my idea or as soon as possible without interrupting others. B, wait until the end of the meeting and then put forward my idea. C, listen to others contributions first before deciding whether my idea is worthy.

Please put your answer, ABC, D, or E in the comments section below the video and I will market for you. Here is your 10 second timer. Okay, brilliant. Well done and don't forget to focus on those leadership principles. Is another one for you to try. Work style assessment test question number five. You propose an idea during a team meeting, but your manager explains to you why it will not work."}
{"question": "What do you do?", "answer": "A, apologise for putting forward a bad idea and don't contribute any further. B, decide that this job isn't for you and start to look for a new job elsewhere where your ideas will be valued. C, accept your manager is right, learn from the experience and think of alternative ideas to contribute to the team.

{"question": "What do you do?", "answer": "A, politely decline the offer of the course stating you are too busy to attend. B, accept the offer of the training course and then find the time to study and complete all your tasks simultaneously. See, tell your manager you are very busy but you would love to attend the course later in the year when you have more time or D, tell your manager you are too busy to attend, but you would be happy if they offer the course to one of your co-workers so it isn't wasted. Put your answer in the comments section below the video."}
{"question": "Don't forget those Amazon leadership principles.", "answer": "Here is your 10 second timer. ABC or D in the comments section below please. Thanks. And try one more before we move on to some different test questions. This is Work style assessment test question seven. You notice one of your co-workers keeps making errors in their work and they are often late completing tasks."}
{"question": "What would you do?", "answer": "A. For the situation you are not a manager and therefore this is none of your business. B, inform your manager of your co-workers under performance so they can deal with the situation. C, tell other people in your team about your co-workers under performance so you can collectively put pressure on them to improve.

Your answer, ABC or D in the comments section below the video for marking. Thank you very much. Here is your 10 second timer. Here we go. So again you can see that those people who learn those leadership principles read and learn them are more likely far more likely to pass their Amazon online assessment test. Let's now try a slightly different type of work style Amazon practice test question. This is test question number eight. So it says read the two statements below one and two and then choose the one statement that best applies to you. Let's have a look at it. Statement number one says I will not take calculated risks when making important decisions and statement number two is I see waste elimination is an important part of budget control and your answer options are statement one or statement two."}
{"question": "So which of those statements one or two best applies for you? Now I would choose statement two why?", "answer": "Well because of the leadership principles."}
{"question": "Don't forget through Galatys states you achieve more with fewer resources and you foster resourcefulness and statement two says I see waste elimination is an important part of budget control.", "answer": "So that statement shows that you are applying the leadership principle of frugality. Now statement number one says I will not take calculated risks when making important decisions but that goes against the leadership principle of bias for action which is value speed take calculated risks but that says not take calculated risks. So that one is not applicable to me because I want to demonstrate those leadership principles again you can see why it is so imperative you learn and understand those leadership principles take calculated risks. Right now it's time for you to try some work style assessment test question number nine. Read the two statements below one and two and choose the one statement the best applies for you. Statement one rules and regulations at work are there to be broken.

D Thursday or e none of the above?", "answer": "Please put your answer in the comment section below the video. Now you should be able to do this just by analyzing the data and numbers on the page. Try doing it without a calculator."}
{"question": "Have a look at each day and see what which one you think has the most orders across the three week period?", "answer": "Here's your 12 second timer. Brilliant. Well done. You are making tremendous progress. Let's now take a look at a different chart. Question 14, the following chart shows the number of five star reviews received by a company in one week."}
{"question": "What is the average daily number of five star reviews?", "answer": "So across the left we have the number of five star reviews received by the company. And across the bottom we have the day of the week. So we have Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday."}
{"question": "Okay, how do we calculate the answer?", "answer": "We'll step one at the total number of reviews for the week. So we have 100 there, 60 on Tuesday, 40 on Wednesday, 100 on Thursday, we have 60 on Friday, we have 20 on Saturday and 40 on Sunday. We had all of those together and that equals 420 but we need to know the average daily number of five star reviews. Well to work out the average we follow step two which is divide the total number of reviews for 120 by the number of days seven and then we get the average. So the answer is 420 divided by seven and the answer there would be 60. So now it's your turn to try some of these test questions. Question 15. Of our Amazon practice test questions. The following chart shows the number of orders a company processes per day."}
{"question": "What is the average daily number of orders processed?", "answer": "So across the left the number of orders across the bottom the day of the week.

Let's now try some numerical reasoning practice test questions that will help you prepare for your Amazon assessment test.

{"question": "If she spends $7 on a drink $5 on chocolate $37 on a dress and $38 on a pair of shoes, how much does she have left? Is it a $17? B $15?", "answer": "See $13 or D nothing."}
{"question": "How do we calculate this?", "answer": "Well here's what we do. Step one. Simply add together all the items purchased by Mary. So that would be $7 $5. $37 and $38. And that equals 87. That's how much she has spent. And in step two simply deduct subtract what she has left from a total amount. $100 she had to spend at the shops minus 87 will give us the answer of C. So now it's your turn to try some of these. It will help you prepare for your Amazon assessment test. Question 17.
