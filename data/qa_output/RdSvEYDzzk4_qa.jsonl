{"question": "Describe a time you demonstrated leadership skills at work.", "answer": "Here we go. I was in a team meeting with a group of engineers and stakeholders discussing an engineering project we were responsible for. Now several engineers from a different department suggested we could cut corners and save money during the project by using a non-standard production part. I immediately intervened and explained the dangers this idea posed. I explained that we had a contractual obligation to deliver the engineering project as per the initial brief and using the non-standard part would go against the contract. I also explained there were serious safety concerns about the part because he had not undergone rigorous testing and on that basis I would not support the idea. Everyone else in the meeting then agreed we should not explore the idea further. And I was pleased I took the lead and intervened for the project safety. That's a really good answer. It's a clever answer because as you know as engineers you need to be safe. It's a top priority and you are demonstrating that in your answer and you are also demonstrating you have the confidence to take the lead and speak out when something is not right. It's a really good answer and that question comes up all the time during engineer interviews. So here's the next question."}

Other strengths include my communication skills, my ability to explain technical ideas and concepts to everyone regardless of their level of knowledge and my critical thinking skills which enable me to solve difficult problems and challenges. I am also not afraid to speak up if I think something can be done in an improved or more efficient way. My enthusiasm, drive and positivity have always been welcomed in every engineering team I have been a part of. In terms of my weakness I sometimes find it hard letting go of engineering projects I am working on. I keep checking things before signing them off and whilst this is good for the safety of a project I need to learn to let the project go once complete and then move on to the next one."}
