So the next sample interview question is based on the leadership principle success and scale bring broad responsibility and the question is tell me about a time when you were faced with a moral dilemma at work. Let's take a look at my answer. A situation occurred whereby I was in a team meeting discussing a client project. All the other team members wanted to cut corners during the project delivery phase to save money but I disagreed with this approach. I felt it was my task to challenge my coworkers and to explain that whilst the client would not be aware that we had cut corners morally it was wrong. I immediately spoke and explained in a professional manner that I was not comfortable with this approach as the client had put their trust in us to deliver things to a very high standard. If we wanted to save money then we should discuss this with the client in an open and transparent manner. Now although my coworkers disagree with my viewpoint they all agreed not to cut corners and to stick with the initial project action plan to ensure everything was done to a high standard."}
