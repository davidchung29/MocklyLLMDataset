{"question": "However, I thought it was important to speak out for safety reasons.", "answer": "It was my task to express my concerns with my boss in a calm and professional manner to achieve the correct outcome. I met my boss in private and explained why I felt allocating the task that a new team member was dangerous. I stated that the company had strict safety policies we should follow and if the task wasn't completed safely, our position could be compromised. I also offered an alternative solution because I'd received training in how to carry out the task safely and competently. I suggested I complete the task while the new team member observed. I also suggested we arrange safety training for the new team member which would empower them to complete all tasks moving forward. After listening to my suggestion, my manager agreed it was the correct course of action to take. Behavioral interview question number three is, tell me about a time when you dealt with a difficult situation. Here's my star method answer. In my previous job, I encountered a challenging situation with my coworker on how to approach a time-at-centitive task. We were responsible for identifying emerging trends and opportunities in our industry to support the company's growth strategy. This disagreement had the potential to affect the completion of the task within the given time frame. The responsibility fell on me to quickly resolve the issue and find a mutually beneficial way to proceed with the task. To address this situation, I initiated a productive conversation with my coworker. I began by actively listening to their proposed approach. I also articulated my own ideas and emphasised the importance of the tasks in the goal. My ideas included assessing the market leaders in the industry to see what they were doing to thrive and also using Google Trends to see what people were searching for. My colleague wanted to focus solely on feedback from previous customers. I agreed to use a combination of our best ideas as opposed to focusing on one thing we were able to complete the task and present our findings to our manager. Behavioral interview question number four is, tell me about a time when you successfully accomplished a task that was entirely new to you. Here is my star method answer. I managed to ask for a volunteer to cover the work of someone in a different department while they were off sick. I had never done their work before but was eager to help the company so I volunteered. It was my task to learn their role quickly to ensure consistency and productivity were maintained. I started by reading their job description and highlighting the tasks I was unsure about. I then studied training manuals and asked other people in the department for tips on task completion before creating a step by step checklist of what I need to do in order to complete my duties. Now although the learning curve was steep by maintaining focus double checking my work and asking for advice when needed I successfully completed their work on time and to a very high standard.
