{"question": "Tell me about a time when you made a mistake and I will then give you a brilliant example answer in a live interview.", "answer": "So I strongly recommend you structure your answer to this and any other behavioral interview question by using the star technique. The star technique stands for situation, task, action and result. So first you start off your answer and you tell the interview at the situation you were faced with. You then briefly outline the task that needed doing. You then move on and give details about the action you took to achieve the task before finally telling the interviewer the results following your actions. So let me now give you a brilliant example answer in a live interview. To the question tell me about a time when you made a mistake. Here we go. Okay Richard, tell me about a time when you made a mistake. When I first started work in my previous role, my manager asked for a volunteer to complete an important time at sensitive task and I agreed to be that person. Now the task involved collecting 12 months worth of company sales figures which my manager needed for an important presentation she was going to give to the senior management team. When I started work on the task, I soon realized I had underestimated how long it was going to take me to complete it. Now because of my mistake, I had to stay behind late after working, chaining and commit extra hours to get the job finished on time. Moving forward, I made sure I never made the same mistake again. I considered carefully each task I was responsible for and I took the time to determine the exact amount of hours and resources it would take me to finish it.
