Given example of a time when you went above and beyond to meet a deadline here we go. In my last role I was working on an important project for a company client. Now the project team consisted of six people however, two thirds of the way through the project two team members went off sick with COVID. This situation had the potential to delay the project by several weeks but this was something I wasn't prepared to allow happen. It was my task to come up with a solution to the problem. I re-evaluated the project goals and determined that some of the work could be outsourced to online contractors. This proved to be a shrewd move because the contractors I ended up hiring had exceptional skills and they were able to improve the quality of project work that was being delivered. For the remainder of the project I also agreed to commit to extra working hours each evening to ensure it was completed on time. I ended up working an additional 17 hours in the evenings leading up to the project deadline to make sure it was finished on time until they expected standard. Now because of this experience I also learned the skill of hiring outsourcers which we utilized in the company on future projects.

The next Amazon leadership principle interview question I want to work through is tell me about a time when you helped a team or company to save money. So this is about through Galatie. Remember Amazon wants its employees to not just help grow the business but help it to save money too. This is a difficult question but here's my example answer to help you."}
{"question": "Tell me about a time when you helped a team or company to save money.", "answer": "Here's my response that uses that star technique here we go. In my previous role I was concerned about how much we were spending on delivery costs. Every day we were sending out hundreds of orders to customers but our delivery company did not appear to be providing value for money. It was my task to evaluate our delivery expenses to see if I could save the company money. I spent the next three hours conducting an analysis of the past 12 months delivery costs and I was staggered at how expensive they were. Now even though the number of orders we were sending out via our delivery company had literally doubled their prices had increased by a third. So I decided to call the delivery company area manager to explain my concerns and to negotiate a fairer price. After a half hour on the telephone outlining my concerns he agreed to reduce the delivery fees back to their previous price for the next 12 months which ended up saving the company more than $5,000 in total. That's a great example answer. It shows that you take ownership another leadership principle. It shows that you care about the company because you are finding ways to help save money and increase company profits. Great answer. Here's the next question. Give an example of a time when you didn't see I2I with a work calling. This is a trick you want. So this is based on the leadership principle of a backbone, disagree and commit. So remember, Amazon is fine to disagree and have an opinion and if you think something's wrong you should speak up but you must commit to the agreed way of working. Here's my example answer to help you. Give an example of a time when you didn't see I2I with a work colleague. Here we go. I was in a team meeting discussing the launch of a new company product. Now a colleague of mine was adamant the best way for us to promote the product was through local newspaper adverts. I disagreed. It was my task to explain using facts and evidence why the best way to promote the new product would be through online advertising. After listening to his arguments for promoting the product in local newspapers I explained that we had a better chance of converting sales by targeting people online by age, gender, demographics and interests. I showed him an example of how a company had been able to surpass all previous company launches by shifting their advertising online. I also explained that we could track the return on advertising investment if we advertised online. Something that was not possible using newspaper adverts. After listening to my reason argument he agreed my suggestion was more beneficial to the new product launch you did a 37% increase in sales compared with previous launches. As a great example of that Amazon leadership principle have backbone, disagree and then commit. So you are saying that you disagree with him and you are explaining why you think that's not the best way to proceed using facts and evidence and you are then persuading the person to choose your way forward. You are all then committing and there is a brilliant outcome for the company in terms of that 37% increase in sales. It's a great example. Now this is another Amazon leadership principle interview question that comes up a lot. It's a difficult one to answer."}

{"question": "What is your favorite Amazon leadership principle?", "answer": "Here we go. My favorite leadership principle is customer obsession. I decided I wanted to work for Amazon after buying many products from your website. Your levels of customer service were always outstanding and I was hugely impressed with your speed of delivery. This made me realise that so many companies out there have it wrong when it comes to customer service. They appear to focus too much on their competitors instead of focusing on their customers. If a company focuses on their customers they won't need to worry about competitors because customers will stay with them for the long term. Now whilst all of the leadership principles are very important, Amazon would be nothing without the customer and that's the reason why it is my first choice.
