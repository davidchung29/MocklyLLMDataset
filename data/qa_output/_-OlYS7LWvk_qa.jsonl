So let me now give you two example answers to the interview question tell me about a time when you had to manage conflicting priorities. Please tell me in the comments section below the video which answer option you think is the strongest. Here's example number one answer option number one tell me about a time when you had to manage conflicting priorities here we go. In my previous role I volunteered to help out on a project that was in danger of failing. Now in addition to this work I also had my regular duties to complete. It was my task to successfully manage all conflicting priorities to ensure everything was finished on time. I started out by speaking to the team members who were working on the failing project. I assessed the priorities of this project and suggested ways I could contribute to the team's objectives. I also analyzed my own workload and I drew up a list of which tasks were urgent and how long they would take me to complete. This gave me a perfect picture of the work I needed to do for both the project and my own responsibilities. Now to manage the conflicting priorities I stayed behind late for an hour each day after work and I met up regularly with the project team members to ensure progress was being made and that we had the necessary resources to get everything finished. Now after two weeks of working on the project and by prioritising my own task I was able to effectively manage all conflicting priorities much to the satisfaction of my manager. Example answer number two tell me about a time when you had to manage conflicting priorities here we go. In my previous job my manager asked for a volunteer to do the work of a team member who was going to be off sick for several weeks. I volunteered to be that person. It was my responsibility to manage both my own workload and the workload of my coworker to ensure all conflicting priorities were managed effectively. I started out by drawing up a list of the responsibilities I would have for both roles putting each task in order of priority. I then calculated how much time each task would take to complete and I set to work. I dealt with all customer service responsibilities first as I felt these were the priority before taking care of administrative duties answering internal queries, responding to emails and maintaining stock levels. To prevent deadlines from getting missed I stayed behind late after work as and when required. By using a structured approach to all tasks and responsibilities I'm by being flexible with my working hours I was able to successfully manage all conflicting priorities. So there is two brilliant example answers to that really difficult interview question."}
