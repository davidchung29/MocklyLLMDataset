{"question": "Tell me about yourself here we go.", "answer": "My name is Richard and I have always been passionate about combining innovation with customer centricity and that's why I am excited about the opportunity to join Amazon. In my previous role at company X I worked on a team that successfully launched a game changing product by embodying the think big principle. We identified emerging market trends and created a product that gave the company a great return on investment. Throughout my career I have consistently exhibited ownership by taking responsibility for both successes and setbacks. For example when we lost two team members during a critical project deadline I stepped up, rallied the team and redistributed tasks to ensure we not only met the deadline but also delivered with uncompromising quality. My skills, qualifications and work ethic are a great match for the leadership principles and my work experience has given me a solid foundation which I believe will add value to the Amazon team. I am genuinely excited about the opportunity to contribute to Amazon's relentless pursuit of customer satisfaction and innovation and I believe my commitment to the leadership principles will enable me to thrive in this dynamic environment. So that is a really good answer to that first Amazon interview question."}

After watching my presentation my manager agreed to its implementation and within several weeks Evernote became a fundamental part of our workplace productivity scheduling and task management.

For example in my current job I disagreed with my manager on how to market a new product launch after providing data and information to back up my claim that we should focus on marketing efforts more online and offline. She agreed to change direction. My weakness is I find it difficult to say no to people. I automatically say yes when people ask me to get involved in additional tasks or projects when I should actually first assess my capacity for the extra work.
