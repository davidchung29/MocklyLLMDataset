{"question": "Behavioral interview question number one, describe a time when you face a challenging situation at work.", "answer": "Here is a brilliant answer that uses the STAR method. I noticed that two team members did not get along in a previous role. Their inability to collaborate effectively was starting to impact the team. My task was to get the team members together to find an amicable solution. I organized a meeting with my two coworkers and expressed my concerns about the situation. I encouraged them to speak openly about their differences and facilitated meaningful conversations that focused on improving their working relationship. At the end of the meeting, they agreed to put aside their differences and work closely on projects to help the team achieve its objectives. Behavioral interview question number two is describe a time when you have to work as part of a team. Again, this answer uses that brilliant STAR method. Here we go. In my last position, I regularly worked on team tasks. One situation comes to mind where the team I was working on was tasked with finding ways to help the company save money. The team's task was to hold a meeting so we could create ideas to help the company increase profits. During the meeting, I suggested we create a new ordering system that would focus everyone's attention on not being wasteful of company supplies and resources. Other people on the team suggested we create a list of software tools we didn't need anymore so we could cancel monthly subscriptions and to also negotiate improved terms with our suppliers. After we presented our best ideas to the supervisor, she agreed to implement them all, which resulted in a 15% reduction in company expenditure. Behavioral interview question number three is describe a time when you have to meet a tight deadline. Here we go. In my previous job, I worked on a team project with a tight deadline. Partway through the project we lost two team members to sickness. This was a challenging situation. I did not want to extend the project deadline so I called a team meeting to find a solution. I suggested we revisit the project brief and each of the remaining team members take on extra responsibilities based on their strengths and areas of expertise. I also suggested we outsource the technical based tasks to online contractors to increase speed and improve efficiency during the project. Our unity and shared commitment to the project were evident throughout. By acting quickly and using creative thinking we finished the project before the deadline. Behavioral interview question number four is describe a time when you have to deal with a difficult colleague or customer. This answer is brilliant again. It uses a star method. Here we go. When I started work at my previous job, I attended a company meeting where everyone was required to present ideas about how the company could grow. Every time I presented a good idea, one of the senior team members dismissed it, which I found frustrating. I wanted to understand why my ideas were being dismissed. So I asked to speak to him privately after the meeting. I explained to him that I was eager to help the company grow and couldn't understand why all my ideas were being dismissed. When I challenged him, he apologized and said his actions were unfair. By challenging my coworker in a calm and professional manner, I was able to significantly improve our working relationship. We became good friends and productive coworkers and he started to listen and consider my ideas. Behavioral interview question number five is describe a time when you made a mistake at work. Here is my brilliant example answer that uses a star method. In my last job, I volunteered to cover the duties of a coworker while they were on holiday. My task was to complete both my work and theirs to ensure the business operated efficiently. Unfortunately, before volunteering to undertake their duties, I failed to assess their priorities, which meant I ended up being linked in completing one of my tasks. Although the task was only one day overdue, this was a mistake I could have avoided if I had conducted a thorough assessment of my coworker's schedule before committing. I learned a lot from the experience and now, before I take on extra duties, I create a list of all tasks and projects to ensure I have sufficient time to meet critical deadlines.
