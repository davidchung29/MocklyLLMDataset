{"question": "Behavioral interview question number two, describe a time when you disagreed with a team member, how did you resolve the situation?", "answer": "Here's my example answer. A coworker and I were tasked with updating the company's website. We both disagreed on the best way to update it. I suggested we keep the website professional looking simple and easy to navigate, whereas my coworker wanted to make it more colorful with lots of pages and blog focused. My task was to find an amicable way forward that was in the company's best interest on one that enabled us to collaborate on the project without conflict. After listening to my coworker's ideas and putting forward my own, I suggested we create two versions of the website and run a test to see which one had the most visitors, engagement and sales conversions. By using this approach, we could test both ideas and the company would get the best results possible. My coworker agreed this was a great idea. After creating two versions of the website and running comprehensive testing, my idea yielded the most substantial returns for the company. Behavioral interview question number three, describe a situation when you delivered excellent customer service. Here's my example answer that uses a start technique. A customer came into the store one morning to pay for a product they had seen listed on our website. When I went to retrieve the product from our store, it had sold out. Understandably, the customer was Irate. It was my responsibility to resolve the situation and put things right for the customer. I immediately apologized. I would feel the same if the situation had happened to me and then investigated or online inventory system to see what had gone wrong. The system had incorrectly allocated the product to our shop. In fact, it was located at our main distribution center. I contacted the distribution manager and requested he dispatch the product immediately to the customer's home address on a 24-hour urgent delivery notice. I then asked my store manager for permission to give the customer a 50% refund due to the inconvenience caused to which he agreed. After apologizing to the customer again and informing her of my actions, she thanked me for my prompt action and excellent customer service skills. Finally, I contacted our IT department and asked them to ensure the same system error never happened again. Behavioral interview question number four."}
{"question": "Tell me about the time when you worked under pressure.", "answer": "Here's my example answer. In my last role, my manager asked me to take up the duties of a coworker who had to take a leave of absence due to personal reasons. I was already working on a time-sensitive task of my own, but I agreed to do the additional work requested. It was my task to reprioritize my workload to include the additional tasks and get everything finished on time. I created a new list of all my responsibilities and used a colour coded system to determine which tasks should be completed first. Hip-tasked were urgent and the tasks came second and green tasks last. I then blocked out my diary, rescheduled several appointments and set to work. By being highly organised, methodical when prioritizing tasks and utilizing my time carefully, I was able to get all my duties completed to an exceptional standard. Behavioral interview question number five."}
{"question": "Tell me about a time when you disagreed with a supervisor.", "answer": "This is a really difficult question to answer correctly. Here's my example response that uses a start technique. My supervisor wanted to launch a new company product by advertising in local stores and supermarkets. I didn't feel this was the best way to get the greatest return from the launch. I felt it was important to disagree with my supervisor and explain in a professional manner the reasons why. I spoke to my supervisor in private and said that my research showed we could potentially get a greater return from our product launch by allocating all of the budget to online adverts including Facebook and Instagram. By using this method we could target a specific audience based on age, gender and interests. I supervise it was intrigued by my suggestion and she agreed to trial 50% of the budget to online advertising for one week. Now after the one week trial was over, the online advertising had yielded a far greater return and my supervisor decided to allocate 100% of the budget to this new method. Behavioral interview question number six."}
{"question": "Tell me about a time when you made a mistake.", "answer": "Here's my example answer. When I started working my first job, my supervisor asked for a volunteer to go and work the following week in a different department because one of their key workers was off sick. I volunteered. I saw this as an opportunity for me to learn more about the company and diversify my skills. Unfortunately, I failed to write down the change of department in my diary and when the following week arrived, the head of department complained to my manager that I had not turned up. I felt awful and embarrassed because I had let my manager and the other department down. I immediately apologized and rushed over to the new department to commence my work.
