{"question": "So to start with what are the Amazon leadership principles?", "answer": "Well, the 16 leadership principles are used every day in Amazon's work, including whenever exploring new product and service ideas or whenever they need to overcome difficult and challenging problems. So they want all of their employees to know the Amazon leadership principles and use them in their everyday work. They are basically the foundations of Amazon's success and in my opinion, Amazon is the greatest company in the world. And predominantly the reason why they have had so much success is because they hire the right people and they want those people to follow and use the 16 leadership principles. So you will be assessed against your knowledge understanding and experience of the 16 Amazon leadership principles. Therefore, you need to know them and understand them. And if you know them and understand them, it makes it far easier for you to get hired with this brilliant organisation. So let's now take a look at a quick overview of the 16 Amazon leadership principles and I will then work through some test questions with you and also give you more importantly some Amazon leadership principles into your questions to prepare for. So the 16 Amazon leadership principles briefly are customer obsession. Now Amazon obsesses over its customers. I use Amazon virtually every day. I think in the last month, I've placed over 30 orders. And I use Amazon because their customer service is so good. If there are any problems, I can contact them online and they will sort it out straight away. Amazon has been so successful because it obsesses over its customers. The next one in particular order is frugality. Now frugality is making sure that you look after resources you use them sparringly because the success of a business or an organisation such as Amazon isn't just focused on its turnover, how much it makes. It's also focused on keeping an eye on profits. So it expects all of its staff to take care of resources and supplies. The next one is that leaders are right a lot of the time. So leaders have the experience and the knowledge at Amazon to make the right decisions. The next one is deliver results. When you work at Amazon, you will be expected to deliver results. It's really important. And that brings me on to the next one which is a bias for action. There's a once people who work for its company to take action, to act with speed and not be afraid to take risks. The next one is learning be curious. So you need to be willing as an Amazon employee to always learn, be open to learning and also be curious. Look into things, find out how things work. The next one is that Amazon always hire and develops the best people. They want to raise the bar every time they hire someone new. And they also want to develop people. So if you were working at Amazon and someone in your team had the potential to progress, you should help them develop the right skills to progress through the organization because then that helps Amazon maintain its position as the number one e-commerce website in the world. The next Amazon leadership principle is a really important one which is dive deep. Amazon expects it to start to look into information and data carefully to dive deep into it because then that gives you the information and data to make the right decisions and to continually improve. The next one is that all Amazon employees should think big. Okay, think big and create brilliant products and services for their customers. So the next of our 16 Amazon leadership principles is insist on the highest standards. And this is definitely one of my favorites because in an organization such as Amazon, if you always insist everyone works to the highest standards achievable, you will gain success. The next leadership principle is invent and simplify. Amazon, once it's employees to come up with brilliant ideas that improve the efficiency of the company and the customer experience and they want to make things as simple as possible. The next leadership principle is strive to be the best employer. So Amazon takes its responsibility seriously. It wants everyone to be safe while they are at work. And it also wants to make sure that it employees a diverse workforce because diversity in any workforce is only a good thing. And it also takes responsibility for the impact it has on our environment. The next one of our 16 Amazon leadership principles is success and scale. Bring broad responsibility again. Amazon because of its success understands that it needs to take responsibility for its actions. The next leadership principle is to have backbone, disagree and then commit. So while that means it's, it wants its employees to not be afraid to disagree if they think something is wrong or if it can be done in a more efficient and effective manner. But it then also wants people to commit to the general consensus of what people are doing in the organization to succeed. And finally, the 16th Amazon leadership principle is earned trust. So you have to build trust between your team members, build trust with customers. And that will help the organization to succeed. So there's the 16 Amazon leadership principles, a brief overview. My interpretation of those leadership principles. So what we will now do is start taking a look at some Amazon leadership principles. Test questions to help you develop your knowledge and your understanding of them. Because as I mentioned previously, the Amazon leadership principles are crucial to your success. So the first question that I want to work through is based on the Amazon leadership principle of customer obsession. So just a quick recap, Amazon is obsessed with its customers, obsessed with giving out standing customer service and also creating products and services that make their customers lives better. So question one states, read the following information before choosing your answer. So I will put up on the screen a scenario and I will then give you four answer options. You choose which answer option you would go for based on the leadership principle of customer obsession. So the statement is, you are working as a customer service representative and a customer calls you during your schedule tea break to complain about the delay in receiving a product they have ordered. Now the customer paid for a 24 hour priority delivery service, but 48 hours have now passed. Answer product is ordered and dispatched. It is in the hands of a third party career company."}
{"question": "What would you do in this situation?", "answer": "Answer option A. Ask the customer to call you back in 30 minutes once your tea break has finished. You will then deal with their complaint. Answer option B, apologise to the customer for the delay in them receiving their product. Ask for their order number until the customer, you will investigate the issue and call them back within the hour with an update. Contact the career company to obtain an exact delivery date before updating the customer and refunding their priority delivery fee. Logic complaint with a career company, it is important to make sure the situation does not happen again. Answer option C, apologise to the customer, but inform them that a third party career company takes care of company deliveries and it is therefore out of your hands. Tell the customer you will refund the fee they paid for the priority delivery service or answer option D, apologise to the customer for the delay in them receiving their product. Ask for their order number before telling the customer to contact the career company themselves to obtain an exact delivery date and time."}
{"question": "Explain to the customer that all orders are handled by a third party career company for which you have no control. So which answer option would you choose?", "answer": "In my opinion, the only one that is relevant and suitable to customer obsession is answer option B. That is what Amazon would do in that scenario.

These scenarios are helping you to develop your understanding and knowledge of the Amazon leadership principles."}
{"question": "What I now want to do is move on and take a look at some Amazon leadership principles into you questions.", "answer": "So you will be assessed against the leadership principles during your forthcoming Amazon interview. The first question we will look at is, tell me about a time when you are to work with limited time or resources. Now this is based on deliver results which is basically get things done on time and to the required standard. Amazon employees are never held back by setbacks or remember that. Now the best way before I give you an example answer to structure your answers to Amazon leadership principles into your questions is to use a start technique. So the start technique stands for situation, task, action and result. So you start off by outlining the situation you were faced with. You then give brief details about the task that needed doing. You then go into specific details about the action you took to complete the task and then finally you finish off and tell the interviewer the results following your actions. Let me now give you an example answer to that difficult Amazon leadership principles interview question."}
{"question": "Tell me about a time when you had to work with limited time or resources that utilizes a start technique.", "answer": "Here we go. In my previous job I was working as part of a team on a very important time-sensitive project. Partway through the project, two team members went off sick which placed enormous pressure on the project due to the lack of resources. It was my responsibility to find a solution to this problem then ensure the project still got delivered on time and to the right standards. So I called a team meeting with the remaining team members and encouraged everyone to put forward their ideas as to how we could get through this challenge. I suggested which commit extra hours to the project and assess which elements we could outsource online to experience and qualified freelancers. Everyone agreed to these ideas and I started assessing which tasks could be outsourced. Now after several hours analysing the project tasks and seeking suitable freelancers online I managed to find someone to be qualified who could do the work we needed. After each team member had committed to an additional three hours work per week and by using the freelancer we still managed to get the project delivered for our company on time and to the expected standard. It's not a really good answer because it is a situational response of situation that perhaps you've been in previously. You give details about the action you took. Now a lot of people would simply go to their manager and say, you know we're a couple of staff down what do we do but you are taking the initiative you are thinking on your feet and you are not being overcome by that setback and that's what Amazon wants people to not be afraid of setbacks to come up with innovative ideas to make sure things are done on time. Let's quickly look at more Amazon leadership principles, interview questions that I recommend you prepare for."}
{"question": "Tell me about a time when you took responsibility for a task outside of your job description.", "answer": "The next one, tell me about a time when you found a simple solution to a complex problem."}
{"question": "Tell me about a time when you had to make an unpopular decision.", "answer": "That's a difficult one. The next one, tell me about a time when you challenged someone's decision. Here's some more."}
{"question": "Tell me about a time when you influenced a positive change in an organization. Tell me about a time when you came up with an idea that improved the efficiency of an organization. Tell me about a time when you exceeded a customer's expectations and tell me about a time when you had to work with limited information or data.", "answer": "These are all really difficult.
