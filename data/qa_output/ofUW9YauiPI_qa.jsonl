{"question": "Why do you want to work for Amazon?", "answer": "And in this tutorial, I am going to give you a number of examples that will help you prepare fully for your Amazon interview. So here's the first example answer to the interview question, why Amazon? Here we go. I want to work for Amazon for five reasons. The first reason is Amazon has an impressive track record of achievement over the years. It has constantly been innovative in the products that it creates and how it delivers its goods and services to its customers. I only want to work for an organization that is constantly moving and driving forward. The second reason why I want to work for Amazon is because having personally used Amazon's products and services over the years, they are always created to a very high standard. You are always trying to solve problems that customers might have and that is one of the main reasons why I believe customers are constantly coming back to the organization. The third reason why I want to work for Amazon is because you are clearly obsessed with customers. In everything you do, I understand that you always start with a customer and you then work backwards. And that's a great model for an organization to have and it tells me that Amazon will always be successful. And I want to work in a role where I am constantly pushed and challenged. And that's the fourth reason why I want to work for Amazon is because I want to work for a company where I will be rewarded for helping other people. So within Amazon, I will get to be creative and innovative and come up with different ideas to help the organization to move forward and also to solve problems for customers. And I believe that will be highly rewarding. The final reason why I want to work for Amazon is because of your leadership principles, your 14 leadership principles. I studied them in detail before applying for this position today and I was impressed by them. I believe they are the foundations of why Amazon has always been successful. And if I am successful in applying for this position, I will look forward to implementing all of them into my daily work. So that was a confident and positive answer to that common Amazon interview question."}
