{"question": "Ari, can you tell me about a time where you have to deal with the failure?", "answer": "Hey, everyone. I'm Diana, as you know, and this is one of the best channels to get tips on async your product management in and of you. Today, we have a very special guest with Ari here today. And I'm going to have her give an intro. Hi, I'm Ari. I'm super excited to be here. Diana definitely helped me a lot both in her YouTube videos. And we did a private session as well. I'm at strike now. I started a little over a month ago. And I got offers from TikTok, lift, stripe, and a series D startup called upside. Awesome. And that's why we have already here today because she serves as the model example how to do behavioral interviews. So today, we're going to be asking Ari a couple questions. So the most asked questions in behavioral interviews. And we're going to see how she aces them. All right. So we're going to get into it. So most behavioral questions or even case questions will start off asking, tell me about yourself."}
{"question": "So are you?", "answer": "Pretend that I'm stripe interviewing you."}
{"question": "Tell me a little bit about yourself.", "answer": "Awesome. Happy to be here. Let me just give you a little introduction to myself. I started my career working in finance initially in investment banking. And then moved into corporate finance at Groupon. My participated in a little internal hackathon and then kind of discovered product management and haven't looked back since. If you've used Groupon before, you're probably most familiar with our voucher product, very annoying to use like you always have to print something out. So the product that I was on was completely rethinking that experience. It was called card linked offers. A user could upload a deal directly onto their credit card, type it as they normally would at like a restaurant and then earn cash back. So I was responsible for the entire consumer experience there initially kind of thinking about growth and then moving a little more into retention and monetization. I then moved to London where I joined Stripe and I was on our advertiser measurement platform team."}
{"question": "So an example I always like to use is if you're overeats and you're trying to advertise on Twitter, you might want to figure out like is this taco creative working or is this hamburger creative working?", "answer": "And so one of the products that I was responsible for was a detesting to help them kind of figure out what's working and not working to be able to get some of those rich insights onto their dashboard. So I'm really excited to be seeking to you at Stripe today to kind of bridge my experience and finance and product. Awesome. All right. Let's talk about what worked and things that folks would have liked to see more. So I'll give a spiel myself and then I'd love to open it up to Arieta. Give what she thinks works. The first thing that stood out. I love the experiences she talked about at Groupon at Twitter. I could really imagine it because she gave really specific products. A lot of product companies hiring today care a lot about consumer experiences. So the way that Ari was able to talk about it shows that she can break things down to explain it to a five year old. The second thing that worked really well was these product buzz keywords. So Arieta's talking the talk, which makes the other person on the other side believe that she's done the work. She mentioned things like retention, A.V. testing, you know, all these PM buzzwords. All right."}
{"question": "What do you think was great about that intro?", "answer": "Yeah. I think one thing that's always resonated with the other side of the interview is being able to latch on to something that they can actually understand the team that I was on at Twitter was actually a pretty back end heavy product. But if you're able to root it in some sort of example that they can kind of understand. I think it helps a lot. And then in your following examples and your behavioral questions, they can kind of remember what you were talking about in the beginning. Yeah. And another thing I for a convention are did amazingly well. She answered a question that was not asked yet, but isn't the back of the mind of the hiring manager, which is why are you good fit for this role. So you saw her at the end saying, I am interested in this role to bridge the gap between product and finance, which she started off in in her early career. So this again shows why she's a good fit. And I always recommend ending with that and tell me about yourself. So great job. All right. The next commonly asked question. So Arya, tell me about a time in your career, where you've had to deal with the conflict. Sure. Just give me a second to just write down some of an example that comes to mind. Yeah. Sure. Take your time. Awesome. Cool. So let me just kind of briefly mention some of my thoughts on kind of conflicts in the workplace. I think that they often fall into kind of three categories. I think the first. It's sort of healthy pushback that you get from your cross functional partners like design and engineering that make the product and the user experience better. I think the second is oftentimes like misalignment on maybe, oh, fast, you want to get to market, which can often be solved in sort of sharing like what's your risk tolerance for some of these things in some vision or a strategy. And lastly, the end of the day, we're all just sort of people. And so you're not going to get along with every single person. And so the example I love to share with you kind of at a mix of all three of these, which I think is an interesting thing. And so this was with an engineering manager that I worked with in the past, who was new to be an engineering manager from an IC when was also new to our team. And so one day I received an email that was copying my manager as well as my skip level and his manager and kind of have like a bullet pointed list of all of the things that he felt were wrong about a certain product decision I had made to include a feature in this MVP. And obviously my initial reaction was very defensive. I think anytime you see your manager or your skip level CC on something you feel like it's an escalation. And I was also kind of surprised because the specific feature that he was kind of calling out and questioning my product decision making there. I thought we had kind of had many conversations back and forth about why we wanted to include this feature or not include this feature. So I sent him a Slack message saying like, hey, here's kind of the document where we kind of talked about this decision and came to something just to jog your memory, but we have a one on one coming up. So let's kind of talk about it live then. And during that conversation, we kind of pretty quickly were able to kind of get to like really what the root cause of the issue was one of the engineers was behind schedule. And so in order to sort of make up for that last time he was like, well, if we get rid of this feature, we can kind of still hit that code complete date. I think getting to that root cause helped a little bit, you know, we were able to advocate to kind of figure out how to get more resources on the team, etc. So after I think this period of kind of tension where it felt like, again, I felt still defensive that why are you escalating this issue in one of the following one on ones that I had with him. I shared that I think that the PM EM relationship is so key to the success of our products and also just to making our relationship good and enjoyable for the duration of the time we're working together. And one thing that I can see that you're perhaps I didn't give that psychological safety and those meetings, for example, for him to be able to say, well, this engineer is behind schedule. Maybe that's something that I could have caught. And maybe there was something that I was not necessarily showcasing to be able to show that that true partnership. And so I think in this example, one thing that I really learned is not every relationship is going to come completely seamlessly and naturally. And in this example, I think it was a relationship that I had to more actively move towards to be able to kind of get to that true EM PM partnership and can kind of happy to kind of to share some of those details of how we got there. But I think that we eventually got there and I think it was an interesting learning that, you know, again, two people are not always going to seamlessly get along, but you can definitely make strides to get there. Awesome. Now, how many of you guys watching are like, that's happened to me because that was my mindset. I was like, I remember that time. My, yeah, I'm also escalated to my manager copied to see everyone else on the email. So one thing that I loved about that story was how much it resonated. A lot of the times when they're looking for product managers, they want to be talking to people with dealt with the same challenges. So are you talking about her conflict with an EM will tell the interview on the other side, I know how to manage these conflicts. So that was the first in this so now the second thing are it was very proactive about sharing what she did in this case that she was being proactive. So a common thing we always talk about as some of you might see in previous behavioral interview videos is you want to focus on the traits or actions that you did in these stories. The context itself is not going to get you very far because the context is going to change from job to job. But in this case, are you focusing on her pulling the EM to the side in a one and one to figure out the root cause. Her then, proactively reaching out to the EM to say, how do we build a strong relationship going forward. Those are the things that traits that they want to see in the people they hire."}
{"question": "Are thoughts from you.", "answer": "Yep, I think I agree with that. I think one thing with conflict stories like you mentioned is the context is not necessarily important, but you want to show that it was truly something that maybe wasn't solved by just like I showed him this data point and it solves the issue because things never are that easy. Yeah, I did love the first rendition. I was like, I showed him the document where yeah, we agreed on everything. I did that as well. I love that. I had a question. You took a second to write things down."}
{"question": "What were you doing? What were you writing down?", "answer": "For sure. I think this is something that you taught me is it's super helpful for me to write down the question, even if it's a rather simple question like conflict writing it down helps me sort of just remember. Then I read just a couple bullet points of like what the story is itself that I want to be able to follow so that I can kind of keep track of my own thoughts. And then the last thing that I do is take a second to really figure out what am I trying to convey in this story as Diana was mentioning. And maybe that's a few sentence like a sentence, a couple words that you want to convey. So here I've written down relationship building ability. Maybe something like empathy that you want to just make sure that that's coming across in your answer. Yes. And because Ria was focused, it did come across right those traits beyond just context of what happened was what stood out and I'm like, yes, I'd hire Arya the putter in the war with the yams that I don't want to do it. Awesome. So given that we dealt with a lot of conflicts, there's sometimes where we also have to deal with failure."}
{"question": "Arya, can you tell me about a time where you have to deal with a failure?", "answer": "Yep. Just give me another couple of seconds to try to down some thoughts. Sounds good. Awesome. I would love to tell you about the first time I had to Sunset a product. I was working on a new monetization product during my time at Groupon. So as a product, I was super excited about it was one of those things where like I really felt like this is going to make Groupon a kind of money. I rallied the troops and was like, this is the next big thing that we're going to work on. I set our success criteria for the initial launch as well as sort of kind of a north star metric that we wanted to eventually get to, which is based on proper per thousand impressions as the metric. So after our launch, we we crushed that initial success metric and you might be wondering, well, how is this end up being sunsetted. So one thing after that initial launch was I started thinking, okay, great."}
{"question": "Now how do we start to build a roadmap to get to that north star?", "answer": "I think that was my mistake number one is that even prior to that initial launch, I should have some idea of how I plan to get to that north star metric. So rather than kind of being near sighted and just looking at that initial success metric, how do I get to where I actually want to get to, whether that be in six months or a year. And that was something that I didn't have. So because I didn't have that now, I'm starting to put together kind of a list of future ideas I brought together one of those same kind of troops that I mentioned of design and engineering to brainstorm. And every time we came up with an idea, we would size it and we were barely moving the needle. They needed to move it by dollars of profit and we were really looking at sense. So this is when I started to really think, oh, like, what are we going to have to do now that we're really not moving the needle and we are so far away from getting to that north star metric. So I remember literally going back to my desk and starting to kind of write down my thoughts here to figure out like what went wrong. You're how did this go from something I was so excited about that now I'm kind of questioning if this is even going to be a successful product in the long term. Some of the things that I noticed with this product is I over-indexed on the numbers, you know, it was really a monetization product and I was like running all these models figuring out how this is going to be successful from strictly a monetization perspective. But when I really thought about it, I was like, what is the user problem we're solving and I couldn't articulate that and I think that's really bad if I was a product manager, I can't articulate the user problem we're solving for. So sort of a solution to a problem that didn't exist. And I think one thing that I could have caught here is just doing kind of basic user research. I remember there was a coworker who was, you know, didn't work in this area at all and she said she saw it on our group on.com page and she said like no idea how the product worked. And so we have an employee who has no idea. I could have done some like really scrappy user research to do some of that kind of gut checking."}
{"question": "Does this make sense or not.", "answer": "So that being said, I kind of had to make the decision to sunset the product, poke at it from every angle to see if I can make it work. And again, there was really no problem that needed to be solved. And so I brought that back to that same group of people. Very nervous because just a quarter earlier, I was saying the opposite to this team. And kind of just like shared with them exactly what I had kind of been going through hoping to be able to bring some of those insights into, you know, these are some of the gaps that I missed. And this is why we need to sunset this product and was kind of hoping that the key takeaway was like we make mistakes. And in this case, I definitely did. But part of that is just product development where you fail and you kind of have to get back on to it. I think that there was a bunch of people who understood that and I remember there was two engineers who were upset because it felt like throw away work and kind of wasted their time. And so with those two folks in particular, I had to really be super diligent about every feature thereafter, like in the couple sprints after every product requirement was like super thorough. I made sure I didn't skip any stands and stuff like that to really be able to get that trust back with them. And so I think some of my learning here were I think there's some tangible things like make sure that you have a sort of a roadmap when you're doing product development. And part of that kind of initial strategy is being able to really articulate a problem and make sure that you have a lot of conviction around that problem and everyone is able to rally about that. And if you do need to sunset a product, you need to be able to regain that trust from your cross-monctional partners. I love that again, another story that resonates I've definitely sunset products before, but what I loved about that story when they ask you these failure stories. They are looking for humility and vulnerability. So when those folks answering the story that like, oh, I failed at not making this thing perfect. That's not what they're looking for. So Ari did a good job of going through a story where she actually failed and lost the trust of some of her co-workers. So that's the first thing that stood out. The second thing that I noticed throughout this story, Ari is sprinkling in again, product skills. She talked about coming up at the metric of what was it, something impressions. I think it's a standard metric. A lot of times when e-commerce. So that's a skill that they're often looking for, and product managers, as you can see in the case studies they gave you, can you come up with success metrics. She also talked about skills that included figuring out what the monetization plan was, the strategy was, and also optimizing for impact. That's what they're looking for. So she gave a failure story. She highlighted some of these successful things that they are looking for in a product manager. And then third thing that I loved. This was a story ultimately. So she gave initially this, we killed it on our success metric. But then you might be wondering why did we sunset it. I know a good story is when there are teasers or some thing unexpected thing that something that was unexpected. So that really continued to engage the audience."}
{"question": "Are your thoughts new?", "answer": "I definitely agree that I think sometimes you need to. I think anytime it's like conflict or failures, maybe just sort of show that are really kind of tell the story at the arc of when you were maybe disappointed in yourself or others were disappointed in you, but then ultimately what the learnings were. I think one piece of advice is sometimes with stories you can have a specific metric like the increased conversion by 5%. But in a lot of behavioral stories, you don't have like a metric of success. So your metric of successes, your key learnings. So maybe try to end every story with a. These are the two things are learned or my biggest takeaway from the story was X. That's a really good point. I think that's a key learnings because they want to show someone who continues to learn can continue to grow. So that is something that I have heard from many companies."}
{"question": "And I'm also curious, Arya, how do you come up with your stories?", "answer": "I know most of my clients, they struggle to remember one specific story for all the 50 hundred variation of question. Yeah, for sure. I remember I also did the same thing where I put together like a hundred most asked questions and a story for each, but that's not sustainable. So in stat, I sort of thought of the five to 10 most memorable career stories for me. Honestly, maybe even closer to five different really big products that I've worked on that have a lot of stories with them. And you can kind of get stories from any of those experiences. So even with the conflict story, there's sort of a follow up with another designer who I conflict with. So you can kind of get a lot of answers maybe from just one key story or product you have done. So that's amazing. So the takeaway with that was focus on five experiences that you had. I think about five products that I've launched in chip. And then to Arya's point, you kind of go deep because throughout that product about life cycle, there were conflicts, failures, ways that you came up with a metric and managed stakeholders."}
{"question": "So go deep thinking about those experiences, which can be hard, right?", "answer": "Yeah. Those were things in our past and you working on that was years ago."}
{"question": "How do you tend to recall them?", "answer": "I think one thing my dad actually taught me is that like if you're kind of in the middle of something that you feel like is going to be something you want to retell later, just document it right now. Like maybe you're like struggling with a coworker or you're working on something that you think is like really successful, just putting like your own personal notes up. So you can kind of refer to it later. Wow, that is very proactive. So come up with a work diary is what I wish I was working like you can kind of like paying old co-workers and stuff like that, fast, to jog your memory."}
{"question": "But yeah, what was that thing we thought about and thing?", "answer": "Yeah. Amazing. All right, we have one last story. So all right, tell me about a time you committed to a deliverable and you couldn't deliver on it. Great. Yeah. And the example from Twitter comes to mind. As I mentioned, I was working with advertisers."}
{"question": "And so one of the specific features that I was working on was one of those features that advertisers were long knocking on our door being like, one is this going to be ready? And so naturally in turn, sales was always pinging me saying, one is this going to be ready?", "answer": "And we finally had a date for our beta launch and everyone was super excited. So when it was kind of finally coming time for that launch, we were not actually hitting our beta success metric, meaning we were not able to kind of pass that threshold to sort of give us the green light to get to beta."}
{"question": "Where I kind of had to make a decision, you know, do we still want to move forward given kind of this excitement around this launch or do I want to, you know, really respect the success metric.", "answer": "And I decided to delay the launch of that beta because ultimately you set success metrics for a reason that being said, then I needed to kind of go back to the folks that I had committed to namely sales to kind of explain what was going on. And so we have this biweekly meeting between product and sales during which I wanted to kind of talk about this. And before going into that meeting, I wanted to make sure I was really prepared and one thing I thought about was if I was sales, what would I ask and like, why, why do they keep pinging me and why are they going to be disappointed in this. The same way product managers think of users and really empathize with them, I tried to now think of sales in this case as my stakeholders that I needed to empathize with and kind of figure out what their needs are. And so there's a couple of things that I knew that they were going to ask me was why, like, why is this delayed what's going on, what happened with the success metric. They were going to say, okay, well, now what, when is it going to be ready. And then lastly, they were going to kind of ask like, well, what's my health like, how do we how do we expedite this in whatever way we that we can. So I sort of prepared questions for all three of these. The first was a little tricky with the why. So I tried to sort of demystify why in the specific example, there are ML models for a little off to kind of get that into a sound bite that they would be able to recognize. The reason they might be concerned with these ML models not working is because they actually showed Twitter in a less positive light as advertisers. It was actually under estimating the effect of Twitter as an advertising tool. And so I knew that was something they would be able to latch on to and they'd be like, okay, yeah, make sense. Like we're not going to launch this unless that's fixed. That was helpful. And then the second is now, when is this going to be ready. And I'm sure you've been in this position sometimes you don't know because you still need to wait for. A root cause for engineering, you still need to kind of get a date for a date. So in lieu of that, I basically put together like a week by week kind of cadence of providing those date for date. So by the end of this week, I'm going to make sure that we have the root cause completed from there. We're going to do like a technical design review and then from there we're going to commit to the work, etc. So rather than this being a biweekly meeting, I said I'll be able to give updates twice a week so that you're able to kind of follow along and was able to give them the geartickets to follow along, etc. And normally maybe that level granularity I wouldn't provide to sales, but in this case, I knew that would be super helpful them to actually track what the end date might be. And then lastly, I had sort of an ask prepared for them as well. I wanted to get another data scientist on our team. And so I had the head of sales, sort of co author this ask with me to be able to get that extra data science resource. So we didn't get that in time for this specific launch when we got them on board later. And I don't think that that would have been possible unless I had sort of this ask prepared in this meeting to really kind of show the case of why this product is important. Next time we can maybe hit our launch date up in a different experience. Awesome. So as with every story we've seen, Ari has been really focused on the particular traits you stranic may."}
{"question": "So I'm curious, can I guess the trait that you're about to convey?", "answer": "And let's try to say it the same time and see if we come up with it. All right. Okay. One, two, three. Empathy. That's how you know you've done a good job when the audience can play back to what they heard. And that is that validated that she was able to successfully convey the traits she's trying to show. And Empathy is a really, really key trait as a product manager, whether you're dealing with the products to deliver consumers or building relationships. So that really stood out."}
{"question": "What do you think worked in that story? What did you like about it?", "answer": "Yep. I think this is probably also an experience many people have had and working with sales as maybe kind of your users because they're your liaison to oftentimes your end users. And I think oftentimes we see sales teams are legal or something as roadblocks to be able to get your product to be shipped. But I think hopefully this story showed that I didn't see them as that, but rather as enablers to be able to get to my user. So like again, sort of empathizing with why they might be excited or disappointed about this product being delayed. Let's hopefully what I'm trying to convey. And she also conveyed other skill like managing stakeholders. Oftentimes as the product manager, you're managing multiple, whether it's leadership, you mentioned sales and figuring out. You mentioned usually we don't give them a week by week update. But in this case to build that relationship, you went out of your way to do the extra work to do that."}
{"question": "You then also sat in their shoes to say, what are they going to need to convey to their consumers?", "answer": "And what's going to be enough to persuade them that this is okay. I really like that one where like I told them that they don't want to look bad in front of customers. Yeah. That also shows strategic thinking. Yes. Amazing. So we saw a star example of what it's like to answer behavioral interviews. So some of the things we talked about just to summarize is one focus on the trait you're trying to convey to talk about the different product skills. Just embed them and sprinkle them throughout your story. And third focus on the storytelling element. Right. Having these teasers, things that we talked about a lot of failure stories. And if you create that heroism, the heroic arc is what a lot of these famous movies are known for. So those are some of the things Arya did any other advice you give and awesome curious. You've been interviewing during a crazy time when the tech market has been down."}
{"question": "Have you struggled?", "answer": "Yeah, I think I got those four offers that for every offer there was probably, you know, maybe 10 on sites that I did legitimately that I didn't get from. It's a tough market. I mean, I think even in a good market product interviewing is very difficult. So you're watching this like hanging there and trying to find the light at the end of the tunnel. I think one thing that Diana shared with me during one of our one on one coaching sessions is to really just kind of show yourself as a person. Like for me, I think that following the star method, for example, to a tea didn't really bring out the traits that I wanted to showcase. So instead of kind of figured out my own way of storytelling and being able to highlight those to show vulnerabilities to show humility. So I think I just like figure out what works for you and don't feel like you need to necessarily stick to one framework rigidly. Yeah, that's such a good point, but do have a structure. I think that's also what Arya did really well throughout. And I think that's what I think about her story about tell me about a time you had a conflict and she's like, these are the three types of conflicts. That's something else they're looking for in your behavioral responses. Because most common mistake will hear is people start rambling. They lose whatever point they're trying to make a trying to figure out as they talk. So that was something already did great throughout. And then as you heard from Arya, it is a struggle. And I think that's why they're not alone. So whoever is watching, because I have seen in a lot of forms or even my own clients dealing with rejection after rejection hanging there. It only takes one job for it to matter. In this case, Arya got four offers, but it was after, you know, a while where she was struggling. So hanging there guys. And again, thank you so much, Arya, for showing us a great example of asing to behavioral injuries. Thank you so much. Thank you."}
