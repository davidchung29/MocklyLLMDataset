The member of staff was needed due to staff sickness in the other department. I made contact with a department head to ascertain the type of skills they would need, the member of staff to have, however, she was unavailable. So I had to decide which member of staff to send them without all the information I needed. So I called another supervisor in the company who I knew had some knowledge about the project they were working on. Now he informed me that it was a technical web-based project and the majority of team members were competent IT workers and strong communicators. Now once I had this information, I then analyzed the strengths of my team and chose a member of staff to send over who I felt would add value to their project. Whenever I have to make decisions we've limited information. I will try to gather facts from other available sources before deciding on the best course of action that is in the best interest of the company. That's a great answer.
