My goal was to find a solution that would improve the team's customer service skills and positively impact the business. I researched various online customer service training courses focusing on those with strong reviews and relevant content. After shortlisting a few, I prepared a proposal for my manager, detailing the benefits of each course and highlighting how improved skills would lead to better customer retention and positive reviews. The training was approved and implemented leading to a noticeable improvement in the team's communication consistency and professionalism.
