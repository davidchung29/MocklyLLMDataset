I contacted the customer immediately, apologized sincerely, and told them I would feel the same as them if the situation had happened to me. I gave the customer time to speak about their experience. I then explained what I was going to do to put things right after I had asked them questions to gain full clarity of the issue. I told the customer I would contact them within the next 24 hours after I had concluded my investigation.

So the second question I was asked at my practice Amazon interview was, why do you want to work for Amazon? Here is that brilliant example answer I gave. Getting hired and building a long-term career at Amazon has always been my number one goal. Amazon has long been the market leader in numerous industries. This tells me Amazon is an organisation that is continually progressing, delivers world-class products and services and provides customer service that outperforms its competitors.

I want to work for Amazon because the leadership principles are a set of values and standards I genuinely believe in and the inclusive workplace culture means there is opportunity for everyone. I love that answer because you are talking about how great Amazon is in respect of customer service that means it outperforms its competitors and you are also saying at the start that you want to build a long-term career at Amazon. That's a really strong answer. Again you can use it when preparing for your own Amazon interview."}
{"question": "The next question was, what is called a behavioral interview question?", "answer": "That question was, tell me about a time you demonstrated one of Amazon's leadership principles at work. Therefore you have to learn and understand Amazon's 16 leadership principles in order to answer this correctly. Now here is that great answer I gave. The following example is based on the leadership principle of customer obsession. The team member had failed to respond to a customer when they had contacted the company to complain about a faulty product. The customer was understandably annoyed and they had left a negative review online. It was my task to turn around their experience, resolve the complaint fully and then retain their custom. I contacted the customer immediately, apologized sincerely and told them I would feel the same as them if the situation had happened to me. I gave the customer time to speak about their experience. Then explained what I was going to do to put things right after I had asked them questions to gain full clarity of the issue. I told the customer I would contact them within the next 24 hours after I had concluded my investigation. After I'd resolved the customers complaint and issued them with a new product, I informed my manager about the situation so they could provide remedial training to the staff member who had let the customer down. That is a really good example answer where I am talking about a specific situation I had previously been in where I demonstrated the leadership principle of customer obsession. Another really good tip for answering the Amazon leadership principles, behavioral questions, is to make sure you use a start technique when responding to those questions. So start stands for situation task action and result. You give details of the situation you were in. You then tell the interviewer the task that needed doing. You then give in depth details about the action you took to achieve the task. And then finally, you tell the interviewer the results following your actions. I'll make sure you use a start technique when answering the Amazon behavioral interview questions. Now the next question I had to answer in my Amazon practice interview was, tell me about a time when you found a simple solution to a challenging problem. Here is that brilliant example answer I gave. In my previous job we had an ongoing problem with communication. I ate some projects and task delegation were becoming increasingly difficult as the company expanded. So I decided to find a simple solution to this difficult problem. After researching online for the best workplace communication and productivity tools, I put together a short presentation on a software tool called Evernote. Evernote would empower managers and team members to keep everyone updated on task and project progression. After watching my presentation, my manager agreed to its implementation. Within several weeks, Evernote became a fundamental part of our workplace productivity schedule and task management and communication improved significantly as a result. So that is another really good answer that's going to help you prepare fully for your Amazon interview. Now the next question is another Amazon behavioral interview question that is focused on how you have previously demonstrated the leadership principles. This question was, tell me about a time when you were able to influence change in an organisation by only asking questions. This is a really difficult one. But here's that brilliant answer I gave. In my last job, I attended a meeting to discuss the environmental impact our company was having. I had several ideas for making improvements. It was my task to influence a positive change by asking three specific questions which I had already prepared. The questions I asked were, have we considered how much waste we were generating?"}
{"question": "Do we think we could be more environmentally friendly in our office practices and have we ever considered implementing a recycling program?", "answer": "The three questions resulted in a healthy debate. I then presented a recycling idea to my manager and she agreed it was a positive step forward. Now after my idea was implemented, we reduced company waste by 75% and everyone in the company adopted a more responsible approach to waste. That's a great example situation where I was in a team meeting asked three specific situations which then resulted in a healthy conversation and positive changes to the organisation's working practices."}
{"question": "Now the next question was, why should we hire you to work at Amazon?", "answer": "Here is that great in-depth answer I gave.
